    abstract = {ABSTRACT The ability to correct for the influence of forest cover is crucial for retrieval of surface geophysical parameters such as snow cover and soil properties from microwave remote sensing. Existing correction approaches to brightness temperatures for northern boreal forest regions consider forest transmissivity constant during wintertime. However, due to biophysical protection mechanisms, below freezing air temperatures freeze the water content of northern tree species only gradually. As a consequence, the permittivity of many northern tree species decreases with the decrease of air temperature under sub-zero temperature conditions. This results in a monotonic increase of the tree vegetation transmissivity, as the permittivity contrast to the surrounding air decreases. The influence of this tree temperature-transmissivity relationship on the performance of the frequency difference passive microwave snow retrieval algorithms has not been considered. Using ground-based observations and an analytical model simulation based on M{\"a}tzler{'}s approach (1994), the influence of the temperature-transmissivity relationship on the snow retrieval algorithms, based on the spectral difference of two microwave channels, is characterized. A simple approximation approach is then developed to successfully characterize this influence (the RMSE between the analytical model simulation and the approximation approach estimation is below 0.3 K). The approximation is applied to spaceborne observations, and demonstrates the capacity to reduce the influence of the forest temperature-transmissivity relationship on passive microwave frequency difference brightness temperature.},
