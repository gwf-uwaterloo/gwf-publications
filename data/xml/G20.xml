A strong understanding of water quality indicators along with the contribution of tile-drained agriculture to water contamination is necessary to assess and reduce a significant source of non-point source pollution. In this study, DRAINMOD, a field-scale hydrology and water quality model, was applied to assess the impact of future climatic change on depth to water table, tile flow and associated nitrate loss from an 8.66 ha agricultural field near Londesborough, in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The closest available climate data from a weather station approximately 10 km from the field site was used by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) to generate future predictions of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperatures required to create the weather files for DRAINMOD. Of the 28 models applied by MNRF, three models (CGCM3T47-Run5, GFDLCM2.0, and MIROC3.2hires) were selected based on the frequency of the models recommended for use in Ontario with SRA1B emission scenario. Results suggested that simulated tile flows and evapotranspiration (ET) in the 2071–2100 period are expected to increase by 7% and 14% compared to 1960–1990 period. Results also suggest that under future climates, significant increases in nitrate losses (about 50%) will occur along with the elevated tile flows. This work suggests that climate change will have a significant effect on field hydrology and water quality in tile-drained agricultural regions.</abstract><url hash="6fdae858">2020.GWF-1.1</url><doi>10.3390/hydrology8010001</doi><bibkey>Golmohammadi-etal-2020-Assessment</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Joint Modeling of Crop and Irrigation in the central United States Using the Noah‐MP Land Surface Model</title><author><first>Zhe</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Barlage</last></author><author><first>Fei</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Helgason</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyu</first><last>Xu</last></author><author><first>Xingtu</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Representing climate‐crop interactions is critical to Earth system modeling. Despite recent progress in modeling dynamic crop growth and irrigation in land surface models (LSMs), transitioning these models from field to regional scales is still challenging. This study applies the Noah‐MP LSM with dynamic crop‐growth and irrigation schemes to jointly simulate the crop yield and irrigation amount for corn and soybean in the central United States. The model performance of crop yield and irrigation amount are evaluated at county‐level against the USDA reports and USGS water withdrawal data, respectively. The bulk simulation (with uniform planting/harvesting management and no irrigation) produces significant biases in crop yield estimates for all planting regions, with root‐mean‐square‐errors (RMSEs) being 28.1% and 28.4% for corn and soybean, respectively. Without an irrigation scheme, the crop yields in the irrigated regions are reduced due to water stress with RMSEs of 48.7% and 20.5%. Applying a dynamic irrigation scheme effectively improves crop yields in irrigated regions and reduces RMSEs to 22.3% and 16.8%. In rainfed regions, the model overestimates crop yields. Applying spatially varied planting and harvesting dates at state‐level reduces crop yields and irrigation amount for both crops, especially in northern states. A “nitrogen‐stressed” simulation is conducted and found that the improvement of irrigation on crop yields is limited when the crops are under nitrogen stress. Several uncertainties in modeling crop growth are identified, including yield‐gap, planting date, rubisco capacity, and discrepancies between available data sets, pointing to future efforts to incorporating spatially varying crop parameters to better constrain crop growing seasons.</abstract><url hash="f6d3b9e2">2020.GWF-1.2</url><doi>10.1029/2020MS002159</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2020-Joint</bibkey></paper><paper id="3"><title>Designing for Recommending Intermediate States in A Scientific Workflow Management System</title><author><first>Debasish</first><last>Chakroborti</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Sristy</first><last>Sumana Nath</last></author><abstract>To process a large amount of data sequentially and systematically, proper management of workflow components (i.e., modules, data, configurations, associations among ports and links) in a Scientific Workflow Management System (SWfMS) is inevitable. Managing data with provenance in a SWfMS to support reusability of workflows, modules, and data is not a simple task. Handling such components is even more burdensome for frequently assembled and executed complex workflows for investigating large datasets with different technologies (i.e., various learning algorithms or models). However, a great many studies propose various techniques and technologies for managing and recommending services in a SWfMS, but only a very few studies consider the management of data in a SWfMS for efficient storing and facilitating workflow executions. Furthermore, there is no study to inquire about the effectiveness and efficiency of such data management in a SWfMS from a user perspective. In this paper, we present and evaluate a GUI version of such a novel approach of intermediate data management with two use cases (Plant Phenotyping and Bioinformatics). The technique we call GUI-RISPTS (Recommending Intermediate States from Pipelines Considering Tool-States) can facilitate executions of workflows with processed data (i.e., intermediate outcomes of modules in a workflow) and can thus reduce the computational time of some modules in a SWfMS. We integrated GUI-RISPTS with an existing workflow management system called SciWorCS. In SciWorCS, we present an interface that users use for selecting the recommendation of intermediate states (i.e., modules' outcomes). We investigated GUI-RISPTS's effectiveness from users' perspectives along with measuring its overhead in terms of storage and efficiency in workflow execution.</abstract><url hash="81d48974">2020.GWF-1.3</url><doi>10.1145/3457145</doi><bibkey>Chakroborti-etal-2020-Designing</bibkey></paper><paper id="4"><title>Rainfall-Runoff Prediction at Multiple Timescales with a Single Long Short-Term Memory Network</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Gauch</last></author><author><first>Frederik</first><last>Kratzert</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Klotz</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Nearing</last></author><author><first>Jimmy</first><last>Lin</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Hochreiter</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have been applied to daily discharge prediction with remarkable success.
Many practical applications, however, require predictions at more granular timescales.
For instance, accurate prediction of short but extreme flood peaks can make a lifesaving difference, yet such peaks may escape the coarse temporal resolution of daily predictions.
Naively training an LSTM on hourly data, however, entails very long input sequences that make learning difficult and computationally expensive.
In this study, we propose two multi-timescale LSTM (MTS-LSTM) architectures that jointly predict multiple timescales within one model, as they process long-past inputs at a different temporal resolution than more recent inputs.
In a benchmark on 516 basins across the continental United States, these models achieved significantly higher Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values than the US National Water Model.
Compared to naive prediction with distinct LSTMs per timescale, the multi-timescale architectures are computationally more efficient with no loss in accuracy.
Beyond prediction quality, the multi-timescale LSTM can process different input variables at different timescales, which is especially relevant to operational applications where the lead time of meteorological forcings depends on their temporal resolution.

Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (δ2 H, δ17 O, and δ18 O values) are commonly used tracers of water. These ratios can be measured by isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy (IRIS). However, IRIS approaches are prone to errors induced by organic compounds present in plant, soil, and natural water samples. A novel approach using 17 O-excess values has shown promise for flagging spectrally-contaminated plant samples during IRIS analysis. A systematic assessment of this flagging system is needed to prove it useful.


METHODS
Errors induced by methanol and ethanol water mixtures on measured IRIS and IRMS results were evaluated. For IRIS analyses both liquid and vapour-mode (via direct vapour equilibration) methods are used. The δ2 H, δ17 O, and δ18 O values were measured and compared with known reference values to determine the errors induced by methanol and ethanol contamination. In addition, the 17 O-excess contamination detection approach was tested. This is a post processing detection tool for both liquid and vapour IRIS triple-isotope analyses, utilizing calculated 17 O-excess values to flag contaminated samples.


RESULTS
Organic contamination induced significant errors in IRIS results which were not seen in IRMS results. Methanol caused larger errors than ethanol. Results from vapour-IRIS analyses had larger errors than those from liquid-IRIS analyses. The 17 O-excess approach identified methanol driven error in liquid and vapour-mode IRIS samples at levels where isotope results became unacceptably erroneous. For ethanol contaminated samples a mix of erroneous and correct flagging occurred with the 17 O-excess method. Our results indicate that methanol is the more problematic contaminant for data corruption. The 17 O-excess method was therefore useful for data quality control.


CONCLUSION
Organic contamination caused significant errors in IRIS stable isotope results. These errors were larger during vapour analysis than during liquid IRIS analyses, and larger for methanol than ethanol contamination. The 17 O-excess method is highly sensitive for detecting narrowband (methanol) contamination error in vapour and liquid analysis modes on IRIS.</abstract><url hash="68b72c41">2020.GWF-1.5</url><doi>10.1002/rcm.9118</doi><bibkey>Millar-etal-2020-Organic</bibkey></paper><paper id="6"><title>Tree water deficit and dynamic source water partitioning</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Nehemy</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Benettin</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Asadollahi</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Pratt</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Rinaldo</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><abstract>The stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen (δ2H and δ18O, respectively) have been widely used to investigate tree water source partitioning. These tracers have shed new light on patterns of tree water use in time and space. However, there are several limiting factors to this methodology (e.g., the difficult assessment of isotope fractionation in trees, and the labor‐intensity associated with the collection of significant sample sizes) and the use of isotopes alone has not been enough to provide a mechanistic understanding of source water partitioning. Here, we combine isotope data in xylem and soil water with measurements of tree's physiological information including tree water deficit (TWD), fine root distribution, and soil matric potential, to investigate the mechanism driving tree water source partitioning. We used a 2 m3 lysimeter with willow trees (Salix viminalis) planted within, to conduct a high spatial–temporal resolution experiment. TWD provided an integrated response of plant water status to water supply and demand. The combined isotopic and TWD measurement showed that short‐term variation (within days) in source water partitioning is determined mainly by plant hydraulic response to changes in soil matric potential. We observed changes in the relationship between soil matric potential and TWD that are matched by shifts in source water partitioning. Our results show that tree water use is a dynamic process on the time scale of days. These findings demonstrate tree's plasticity to water supply over days can be identified with high‐resolution measurements of plant water status. Our results further support that root distribution alone is not an indicator of water uptake dynamics. Overall, we show that combining physiological measurements with traditional isotope tracing can reveal mechanistic insights into plant responses to changing environmental conditions.</abstract><url hash="f1be7dfb">2020.GWF-1.6</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14004</doi><bibkey>Nehemy-etal-2020-Tree</bibkey></paper><paper id="7"><title>Wastewater sample site selection to estimate geographically-resolved community prevalence of COVID-19: A research protocol</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Yeager</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Holm</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Saurabh</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Fuqua</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Talley</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Bhatnagar</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Smith</last></author><abstract>Background: Wastewater monitoring for virus infections within communities can complement conventional clinical surveillance. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 testing is performed during clinical encounters with symptomatic individuals, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance and can effectively surveil communities with less temporal lag than other surveillance methods. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Methods: Herein we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky which may have general applicability for cities throughout the United States. This approach was developed by the selection of sampling locations along sewer lines transporting raw wastewater from geographically and demographically distinct areas that correspond with locations where random testing of residents occurs. Conclusions: Development of this protocol for population-level sampling for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater can be utilized to inform consistent wastewater monitoring among cities for up-to-date and geographically-resolved information on COVID-19 prevalence within communities. This information could substantially supplement public health surveillance of COVID-19 and thus serve to better guide targeted mitigation strategies throughout the United States.</abstract><url hash="86b94d6d">2020.GWF-1.7</url><doi>10.1101/2020.08.23.20180224</doi><bibkey>Yeager-etal-2020-Wastewater</bibkey></paper><paper id="8"><title>Anoxygenic photosynthesis and iron–sulfur metabolic potential of Chlorobia populations from seasonally anoxic Boreal Shield lakes</title><author><first>J.</first><last>M.

The climate of Northland can be separated into four distinct regions: the Southern Hemisphere ocean, the seasonally wet tropics, the midlatitude desert, and the Great Northern Swamp. We evaluate how modifying land surface properties on Northland drives changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns, the global energy budget, and atmospheric dynamics. We observe a surprising response to changes in land surface evaporation, where suppressing terrestrial evaporation in Northland cools both land and ocean. In previous studies, suppressing terrestrial evaporation has been found to lead to local warming by reducing latent cooling of the land surface. However, reduced evaporation can also decrease atmospheric water vapor, reducing the strength of the greenhouse effect and leading to large-scale cooling. We use a set of idealized climate model simulations to show that suppressing terrestrial evaporation over Northern Hemisphere continents of varying size can lead to either warming or cooling of the land surface, depending on which of these competing effects dominates. We find that a combination of total land area and contiguous continent size controls the balance between local warming from reduced latent heat flux and large-scale cooling from reduced atmospheric water vapor. Finally, we demonstrate how terrestrial heat capacity, albedo, and evaporation all modulate the location of the ITCZ both over the continent and over the ocean.</abstract><url hash="6101606a">2020.GWF-1.9</url><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-20-0452.1</doi><bibkey>Lague-etal-2020-Terrestrial</bibkey></paper><paper id="10"><title>Size‐based characterization of freshwater dissolved organic matter finds similarities within a waterbody type across different Canadian ecozones</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Aukes</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Schiff</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Elgood</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Spoelstra</last></author><abstract>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents a mixture of organic molecules that vary due to different source materials and degree of processing.

Using a size‐exclusion chromatography technique (liquid chromatography‐organic carbon detection [LC‐OCD]), we assessed the variability in DOM composition from both surface and groundwaters across a number of Canadian ecozones (mean annual temperature spanning −10°C to +6°C). A wide range in DOM concentration was found from 0.2 to 120 mg C L−1. Proportions of different size‐based groupings across ecozones were variable, yet similarities between specific waterbody types, regardless of location, suggest commonality in the processes dictating DOM composition. A principal component analysis identified 70% of the variation in LC‐OCD derived DOM compositions could be explained by the waterbody type. We find that DOM composition within a specific waterbody type is similar regardless of the differences in climate or surrounding vegetation where the sample originated from.</abstract><url hash="9104dc0f">2020.GWF-1.10</url><doi>10.1002/lol2.10180</doi><bibkey>Aukes-etal-2020-Size‐based</bibkey></paper><paper id="11"><title>Permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands is rapidly altering forest community composition</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Dearborn</last></author><author><first>Cory</first><last>A. Wallace</last></author><author><first>Rajit</first><last>Patankar</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Boreal peatlands are frequently underlain by permafrost, which is thawing rapidly. A common ecological response to thaw is the conversion of raised forested plateaus to treeless wetlands, but unexplained spatial variation in responses, combined with a lack of stand‐level data, make it difficult to predict future trajectories of boreal forest composition and structure. We sought to characterize patterns and identify drivers of forest structure, composition, mortality and recruitment in a boreal peatland experiencing permafrost thaw. To do this, we established a large (10 ha) permanent forest plot (completed in 2014), located in the Northwest Territories, Canada, that includes 40,584 mapped and measured trees. In 2018, we conducted a comprehensive mortality and recruitment recensus. We also measured frost table depth, soil moisture, soil humification and organic layer thickness within the plot between 2012 and 2018, and used habitat association tests to link these variables to forest characteristics and dynamics. Forest composition and structure varied markedly throughout the plot and were strongly governed by patterns in permafrost presence and organic layer thickness. Overall, there was a net loss of trees from the plot at a rate of 0.7% year−1. Mortality of black spruce, the dominant tree species, was more than double that of recruitment and was strongly associated with permafrost thaw. In contrast, recruitment of larch was over four times greater than mortality, and occurred primarily in low‐lying, permafrost‐free wetlands with mineral soil near the surface. Synthesis. The trends in tree demography and underlying drivers suggest that spruce‐dominated permafrost plateaus will be converted into larch‐dominated wetlands as permafrost thaw progresses in boreal peatlands, particularly in areas where mineral soil is near the surface. In the longer term, thaw could increase the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape, resulting in widespread drainage and re‐vegetation by spruce, but we did not find evidence that this is occurring yet. Given the increasing rates of permafrost thaw, and positive feedbacks between thaw and forest change, we predict that larch abundance will continue to increase in boreal peatlands over the coming decades, leading to shifts in ecosystem function, wildlife habitat, albedo and snow dynamics.</abstract><url hash="e603ec99">2020.GWF-1.11</url><doi>10.1111/1365-2745.13569</doi><bibkey>Dearborn-etal-2020-Permafrost</bibkey></paper><paper id="12"><title>Human biomonitoring results of contaminant and nutrient biomarkers in Old Crow, Yukon, Canada.</title><author><first>Mallory</first><last>Drysdale</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Ratelle</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Skinner</last></author><author><first>Joshua</first><last>Garcia-Barrios</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Gamberg</last></author><author><first>Megan</first><last>Williams</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Majowicz</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Bouchard</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Stark</last></author><author><first>Dan</first><last>Chalil</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Laird</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7f0abd23">2020.GWF-1.12</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143339</doi><bibkey>Drysdale-etal-2020-Human</bibkey></paper><paper id="13"><title>allodb: An R package for biomass estimation at globally distributed extratropical forest plots</title><author><first>E.</first><last>Gonzalez-Akre</last></author><author><first>Camille</first><last>Piponiot</last></author><author><first>Mauro</first><last>L.

Changes in vegetation structure and function are expected to alter soil thermal regimes, thereby modifying climate feedbacks related to permafrost thaw and carbon cycling. However, current understanding of vegetation impacts on soil temperature is limited to local or regional scales and lacks the generality necessary to predict soil warming and permafrost stability on a pan-Arctic scale. Here we synthesize shallow soil and air temperature observations with broad spatial and temporal coverage collected across 106 sites representing nine different vegetation types in the permafrost region. We showed ecosystems with tall-statured shrubs and trees (&gt;40 cm) have warmer shallow soils than those with short-statured tundra vegetation when normalized to a constant air temperature. In tree and tall shrub vegetation types, cooler temperatures in the warm season do not lead to cooler mean annual soil temperature indicating that ground thermal regimes in the cold-season rather than the warm-season are most critical for predicting soil warming in ecosystems underlain by permafrost. Our results suggest that the expansion of tall shrubs and trees into tundra regions can amplify shallow soil warming, and could increase the potential for increased seasonal thaw depth and increase soil carbon cycling rates and lead to increased carbon dioxide loss and further permafrost thaw.</abstract><url hash="96691816">2020.GWF-1.14</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/abc994</doi><bibkey>Kropp-etal-2020-Shallow</bibkey></paper><paper id="15"><title>Drivers and health implications of the dietary transition among Inuit in the Canadian Arctic: a scoping review</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Little</last></author><author><first>Hilary</first><last>Hagar</last></author><author><first>Chloe</first><last>Zivot</last></author><author><first>Warren</first><last>Dodd</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Skinner</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Kenny</last></author><author><first>Amy</first><last>Caughey</last></author><author><first>Josephine</first><last>Gaupholm</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Lemire</last></author><abstract>Abstract Objective: The current study undertook a systematic scoping review on the drivers and implications of dietary changes among Inuit in the Canadian Arctic. Design: A keyword search of peer-reviewed articles was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Circumpolar Health Bibliographic Database and High North Research Documents. Eligibility criteria included all full-text articles of any design reporting on research on food consumption, nutrient intake, dietary adequacy, dietary change, food security, nutrition-related chronic diseases or traditional food harvesting and consumption among Inuit populations residing in Canada. Articles reporting on in vivo and in vitro experiments or on health impacts of environmental contaminants were excluded. Results: A total of 162 studies were included. Studies indicated declining country food (CF) consumption in favour of market food (MF). Drivers of this transition include colonial processes, poverty and socio-economic factors, changing food preferences and knowledge, and climate change. Health implications of the dietary transition are complex. Micro-nutrient deficiencies and dietary inadequacy are serious concerns and likely exacerbated by increased consumption of non-nutrient dense MF. Food insecurity, overweight, obesity and related cardiometabolic health outcomes are growing public health concerns. Meanwhile, declining CF consumption is entangled with shifting culture and traditional knowledge, with potential implications for psychological, spiritual, social and cultural health and well-being. Conclusions: By exploring and synthesising published literature, this review provides insight into the complex factors influencing Inuit diet and health. Findings may be informative for future research, decision-making and intersectoral actions around risk assessment, food policy and innovative community programmes.</abstract><url hash="e16e2880">2020.GWF-1.15</url><doi>10.1017/S1368980020002402</doi><bibkey>Little-etal-2020-Drivers</bibkey></paper><paper id="16"><title>Expert assessment of future vulnerability of the global peatland carbon sink</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Loisel</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Gallego-Sala</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Amesbury</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Magnan</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Anshari</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Beilman</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>C.

A popularized assumption in some literature is that youth have little to contribute to discussions on climate change and other aspects of land and resource management; such downplay of youth expertise and engagement may be contributing to climate anxiety (e.g., feelings of hopelessness), particularly in remote communities. Creating opportunities for youth to have a voice in global forums such as the United Nations Conference of Parties (COP24) on Climate Change may offset such anxiety. Building on previous research related to climate action, and the well-being of Indigenous youth, this paper shares the outcomes of research with Indigenous youth (along with family and teachers) from the Mackenzie River Basin who attended COP24 to determine the value of their experience. Key questions guiding these interviews included: How did youth impact others? and How did youth benefit from the experience? Key insights related to the value of a global experience; multiple youth presentations at COP24 were heard by hundreds of people who sought to learn more from youth about their experience of climate change. Additional insights were gathered about the importance of family and community (i.e., webs of support); social networks were seen as key to the success of youth who participated in the event and contributed to youth learning and leadership development.</abstract><url hash="9fdf543d">2020.GWF-1.18</url><doi>10.3390/su12166299</doi><bibkey>MacKay-etal-2020-Youth</bibkey></paper><paper id="19"><title>Improving sub-canopy snow depth mapping with unmanned aerial vehicles: lidar versus structure-from-motion techniques</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Harder</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Helgason</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Vegetation has a tremendous influence on snow processes
and snowpack dynamics, yet remote sensing techniques to resolve the spatial
variability of sub-canopy snow depth are not always available and are
difficult from space-based platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have
had recent widespread application to capture high-resolution information on
snow processes and are herein applied to the sub-canopy snow depth
challenge. Previous demonstrations of snow depth mapping with UAV structure
from motion (SfM) and airborne lidar have focussed on non-vegetated surfaces
or reported large errors in the presence of vegetation. In contrast,
UAV-lidar systems have high-density point clouds and measure returns from a
wide range of scan angles, increasing the likelihood of successfully sensing
the sub-canopy snow depth. The effectiveness of UAV lidar and UAV SfM in
mapping snow depth in both open and forested terrain was tested in a 2019
field campaign at the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory, Alberta, and
at Canadian prairie sites near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Only
UAV lidar could successfully measure the sub-canopy snow surface with
reliable sub-canopy point coverage and consistent error metrics
(root mean square error (RMSE) &lt;0.17 m and bias −0.03 to −0.13 m). Relative to UAV lidar, UAV SfM
did not consistently sense the sub-canopy snow surface, the interpolation
needed to account for point cloud gaps introduced interpolation artefacts,
and error metrics demonstrated relatively large variability (RMSE&lt;0.33 m and bias 0.08 to −0.14 m). With the demonstration of sub-canopy snow
depth mapping capabilities, a number of early applications are presented to
showcase the ability of UAV lidar to effectively quantify the many
multiscale snow processes defining snowpack dynamics in mountain and prairie
environments.

With growing interest in groundwater‐surface water interactions and subsurface flow paths, hydrologists are increasingly looking deeper. But the dialog between surface water hydrologists and groundwater hydrologists is still embryonic, and many basic questions are yet to be posed, let alone answered. One key question is: where is the bottom of a watershed? Knowing where to draw the bottom boundary has not yet been fully addressed in the literature, and how to define the watershed “bottom” is a fraught question. There is large variability across physical and conceptual models regarding how to implement a watershed bottom, and what counts as “deep” varies markedly in different communities. In this commentary, we seek to initiate a dialog on existing approaches to defining the bottom of the watershed. We briefly review the current literature describing how different communities typically frame the answer of just how deep we should look and identify situations where deep flow paths are key to developing realistic conceptual models of watershed systems. We then review the common conceptual approaches used to delineate the watershed lower boundary. Finally, we highlight opportunities to trigger this potential research area at the interface of catchment hydrology and hydrogeology.</abstract><url hash="ba298fcc">2020.GWF-1.20</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR026010</doi><bibkey>Condon-etal-2020-Where</bibkey></paper><paper id="21"><title>Bordering sustainability in the Anthropocene</title><author><first>Simon</first><last>Dalby</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT While environmental matters rarely respect political boundaries, efforts to govern resource, pollution, wildlife and numerous other matters are often profoundly shaped by territorial jurisdiction. Direct regulation, trade restrictions and forms of international cooperation have all shaped global efforts at environmental governance, while fortress conservation ideas frequently invoke territorial exclusivity. The context for these measures has been changing both as a consequence of the growth of the global economy and as a result of the biophysical transformations that are integral to this expansion through the period of the great acceleration. Climate adaptation practices frequently invoked practices of enclosure and expulsion that are often counter-productive. Novel circumstances due to accelerating Anthropocene change now shape the policy landscape, while numerous policy-makers grapple with how to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. These require rethinking the bordering practices that govern environmental matters and the relationships of territory to ecological function. This is necessary now not least because of increased natural system instability, the new condition of non-stationarity and the inadequacy of stable base line assumptions for dealing with rapid change across boundaries.</abstract><url hash="cd2ebf5a">2020.GWF-1.21</url><doi>10.1080/21622671.2018.1559758</doi><bibkey>Dalby-etal-2020-Bordering</bibkey></paper><paper id="22"><title>Deep Meteoric Water Circulation in Earth's Crust</title><author><first>J.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><abstract>Deep meteoric waters comprise a key component of the hydrologic cycle, transferring water, energy, and life between the Earth's surface and deeper crustal environments, yet little is known about the nature and extent of meteoric water circulation.

Shallower circulation occurs in sedimentary and shield‐type environments with subdued topography. The amount of topographic relief available to drive regional groundwater flow and flush saline fluids is an important control on the extent of meteoric water circulation, in addition to permeability. The presence of an active flow system in the upper few kilometers of the Earth's crust and stagnant brines trapped by negative buoyancy offers a new framework for understanding deep groundwater systems.</abstract><url hash="5427eee0">2020.GWF-1.22</url><doi>10.1029/2020GL090461</doi><bibkey>McIntosh-etal-2020-Deep</bibkey></paper><paper id="23"><title>Rethinking groundwater age</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Cuthbert</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Befus</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Gleeson</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><abstract /><url hash="2320de76">2020.GWF-1.23</url><doi>10.1038/s41561-020-0629-7</doi><bibkey>Ferguson-etal-2020-Rethinking</bibkey></paper><paper id="24"><title>Editors’ Choice—Review—Conductive Forms of MoS2 and Their Applications in Energy Storage and Conversion</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Saha</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kruse</last></author><abstract /><url hash="bd444bd5">2020.GWF-1.24</url><doi>10.1149/1945-7111/abb34b</doi><bibkey>Saha-etal-2020-Editors’</bibkey></paper><paper id="25"><title>Peroxide-Induced Tuning of the Conductivity of Nanometer-Thick MoS2 Films for Solid-State Sensors</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Saha</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kruse</last></author><abstract>Applications of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in energy storage devices, solar cells, electrocatalysts, and sensors require good electrical conductivity.

E. Rahman</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Wahid</last></author><abstract>IoT (Internet of Things)-based remote monitoring and controlling applications are increasing in dimensions and domains day by day. Sensor-based remote monitoring using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) becomes challenging for applications when both temporal and spatial data from widely spread sources are acquired in real time. In applications such as environmental, agricultural, and water quality monitoring, the data sources are geographically distributed, and have little or no cellular connectivity. These applications require long-distance wireless or satellite connections for IoT connectivity. Present WSNs are better suited for densely populated applications and require a large number of sensor nodes and base stations for wider coverage but at the cost of added complexity in routing and network organization. As a result, real time data acquisition using an IoT connected WSN is a challenge in terms of coverage, network lifetime, and wireless connectivity. This paper proposes a lightweight, dynamic, and auto-reconfigurable communication protocol (LDAP) for Wide-Area Remote Monitoring (WARM) applications. It has a mobile data sink for wider WSN coverage, and auto-reconfiguration capability to cope with the dynamic network topology required for device mobility. The WSN coverage and lifetime are further improved by using a Long-Range (LoRa) wireless interface. We evaluated the performance of the proposed LDAP in the field in terms of the data delivery rate, Received Signal Strength (RSS), and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). All experiments were conducted in a field trial for a water quality monitoring application as a case study. We have used both static and mobile data sinks with static sensor nodes in an IoT-connected environment. The experimental results show a significant reduction (up to 80%) of the number of data sinks while using the proposed LDAP. We also evaluated the energy consumption to determine the lifetime of the WSN using the LDAP algorithm.</abstract><url hash="534a2af9">2020.GWF-1.26</url><doi>10.3390/rs12193131</doi><bibkey>M. E.

Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and Zn2+ is a very important one among them. Zn2+ has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn2+ is a Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn2+ undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH, and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn2+ a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn2+‐dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA‐/DNA‐cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn2+ concentration and pH‐dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn2+, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA, and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn2+, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn2+‐dependent DNAzymes.</abstract><url hash="c3f53768">2020.GWF-1.29</url><doi>10.1002/cbic.202000586</doi><bibkey>J.

Subsurface flow dynamics steer the transport and transformation of contaminants, carbon, weathering products and other biogeochemistry. The distribution of groundwater ages with depth is a key feature of these flow dynamics. Predicting these ages are a strong test of hypotheses about subsurface structures and time‐varying processes. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)‐based groundwater ages revealed an unexpected groundwater age stratification in a 0.47 km2 forested catchment called Svartberget in northern Sweden. An overall groundwater age stratification, representative for the Svartberget site, was derived by measuring CFCs from nine different wells with depths of 2–18 m close to the stream network. Immediately below the water table, CFC‐based groundwater ages of already 30 years that increased with depth were found. Using complementary groundwater flow models, we could reproduce the observed groundwater age stratification and show that the 30 year lag in rejuvenation comes from return flow of groundwater at a subsurface discharge zone that evolves along the interface between two soil types. By comparing the observed groundwater age stratification with a simple analytical approximation, we show that the observed lag in rejuvenation can be a powerful indicator of the extent and structure of the subsurface discharge zone, while the vertical gradient of the age‐depth‐relationship can still be used as a proxy of the overall aquifer recharge even when sampled in the discharge zone. The single age stratification profile measured in the discharge zone, close to the aquifer outlet, can reveal the main structure of the groundwater flow pattern from recharge to discharge. This groundwater flow pattern provides information on the participation of groundwater in the hydrological cycle and indicates the lower boundary of hydrological connectivity.</abstract><url hash="d4358e1b">2020.GWF-1.31</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13753</doi><bibkey>Kolbe-etal-2020-Lagged</bibkey></paper><paper id="32"><title>Estimating Concurrent Climate Extremes: A Conditional Approach</title><author><first>Whitney</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Monahan</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4d3cdfa1">2020.GWF-1.32</url><doi>10.1016/J.WACE.2021.100332</doi><bibkey>Huang-etal-2020-Estimating</bibkey></paper><paper id="33"><title>Modelling the impacts of climate and land use change on water security in a semi-arid forested watershed using InVEST</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Daneshi</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Najafinejad</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Panahi</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Zarandian</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>F.

This paper presents hydrometeorological, glaciological
and geospatial data from the Peyto Glacier Research Basin (PGRB) in the
Canadian Rockies. Peyto Glacier has been of interest to glaciological and
hydrological researchers since the 1960s, when it was chosen as one of five
glacier basins in Canada for the study of mass and water balance during the
International Hydrological Decade (IHD, 1965–1974). Intensive studies of the
glacier and observations of the glacier mass balance continued after the
IHD, when the initial seasonal meteorological stations were discontinued,
then restarted as continuous stations in the late 1980s. The corresponding
hydrometric observations were discontinued in 1977 and restarted in 2013.
Datasets presented in this paper include high-resolution, co-registered
digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from original air photos and lidar surveys; hourly off-glacier
meteorological data recorded from 1987 to the present; precipitation data from
the nearby Bow Summit weather station; and long-term hydrological and glaciological model
forcing datasets derived from bias-corrected reanalysis products. These data
are crucial for studying climate change and variability in the basin and
understanding the hydrological responses of the basin to both glacier and
climate change. The comprehensive dataset for the PGRB is a valuable and
exceptionally long-standing testament to the impacts of climate change on
the cryosphere in the high-mountain environment. The dataset is publicly
available from Federated Research Data Repository at

al., 2020).

Seasonal changes in the color of evergreen forest canopies have been documented with near‐surface remote sensing, but the physiological mechanisms underlying these changes, and the implications for photosynthetic uptake, have not been fully elucidated. Here, we integrate on‐the‐ground phenological observations, leaf‐level physiological measurements, near surface hyperspectral remote sensing and digital camera imagery, tower‐based CO2 flux measurements, and a predictive model to simulate seasonal canopy color dynamics. We show that seasonal changes in canopy color occur independently of new leaf production, but track changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, the photochemical reflectance index, and leaf pigmentation. We demonstrate that at winter‐dormant sites, seasonal changes in canopy color can be used to predict the onset of canopy‐level photosynthesis in spring, and its cessation in autumn. Finally, we parameterize a simple temperature‐based model to predict the seasonal cycle of canopy greenness, and we show that the model successfully simulates interannual variation in the timing of changes in canopy color. These results provide mechanistic insight into the factors driving seasonal changes in evergreen canopy color and provide opportunities to monitor and model seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity using color‐based vegetation indices.</abstract><url hash="daee0629">2020.GWF-1.39</url><doi>10.1111/nph.17046</doi><bibkey>Seyednasrollah-etal-2020-Seasonal</bibkey></paper><paper id="40"><title>Representativeness of Eddy-Covariance flux footprints for areas surrounding AmeriFlux sites</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Chu</last></author><author><first>Xiangzhong</first><last>Luo</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Ouyang</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>S.

The team took a quantitative approach and assessed relationships between seasonality, location, and type of community against the number of drinking water advisories in Saskatchewan for a 4-year period from 2012 to 2016. Generalised estimating equations were used to determine significant factors contributing to the likelihood of drinking water advisories comparing Indigenous to non-Indigenous communities of similar sizes. Results indicated that the season and the interaction between community type and region (north vs. south) were significant in the model for counts of advisories. Reserve communities in the north had a drinking water advisory count that was 5.19 times greater than those of reserves in the south, 2.63 times greater than counts for towns in the south and 4.94 times greater than those of villages in the south. Additional comparisons indicated that reserves in the north had 2.43 times as many advisories as villages in the north, but towns situated in the south part of the province had 1.98 times as many advisories as reserves in the south, and 1.88 times as many advisories as villages in the south. The work confirms heightened risk among northern Indigenous communities and suggests that increased attention to, and investment in, securing water resources is necessary in rural Saskatchewan and globally.</abstract><url hash="757a79f0">2020.GWF-1.43</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2020.1831404</doi><bibkey>McLeod-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="44"><title>Glacier recession alters stream water quality characteristics facilitating bloom formation in the benthic diatom Didymosphenia geminata.</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Brahney</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Bothwell</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Capito</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Gray</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Null</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Curtis</last></author><abstract /><url hash="eb1eec53">2020.GWF-1.44</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142856</doi><bibkey>Brahney-etal-2020-Glacier</bibkey></paper><paper id="45"><title>Rock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms: Overlooked climate refugia for mountain biodiversity</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Brighenti</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Hotaling</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Finn</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Fountain</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Herbst</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Saros</last></author><author><first>Lusha</first><last>M.

Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the ecological effects of alpine glacier and snowfield recession. However, much less attention has been given to identifying climate refugia in mountain ecosystems where present‐day environmental conditions will be maintained, at least in the near‐term, as other habitats change. Around the world, montane communities of microbes, animals, and plants live on, adjacent to, and downstream of rock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms (CRL). These geomorphological features have been overlooked in the ecological literature despite being extremely common in mountain ranges worldwide with a propensity to support cold and stable habitats for aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. CRLs are less responsive to atmospheric warming than alpine glaciers and snowfields due to the insulating nature and thermal inertia of their debris cover paired with their internal ventilation patterns. Thus, CRLs are likely to remain on the landscape after adjacent glaciers and snowfields have melted, thereby providing longer‐term cold habitat for biodiversity living on and downstream of them. Here, we show that CRLs will likely act as key climate refugia for terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in mountain ecosystems, offer guidelines for incorporating CRLs into conservation practices, and identify areas for future research.</abstract><url hash="9c19dcc5">2020.GWF-1.45</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.15510</doi><bibkey>Brighenti-etal-2020-Rock</bibkey></paper><paper id="46"><title>Hydrogeological characterization of an alpine aquifer system in the Canadian Rocky Mountains</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Christensen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bentley</last></author><abstract /><url hash="05108d7f">2020.GWF-1.46</url><doi>10.1007/s10040-020-02153-7</doi><bibkey>Christensen-etal-2020-Hydrogeological</bibkey></paper><paper id="47"><title>Snow cover duration trends observed at sites and predicted by multiple models</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Essery</last></author><author><first>Hyungjun</first><last>Kim</last></author><author><first>Libo</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Bartlett</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Boone</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Brutel-Vuilmet</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Burke</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Cuntz</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Decharme</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Dutra</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Gusev</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Hagemann</last></author><author><first>V.</first><last>Haverd</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Kontu</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Krinner</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Lafaysse</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Lejeune</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Marke</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Marks</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Marty</last></author><author><first>Cecile</first><last>B Menard</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Nasonova</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Nitta</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Schaedler</last></author><author><first>V.</first><last>Semenov</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Smirnova</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Swenson</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Turkov</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Wever</last></author><author><first>Hua</first><last>Yuan</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The 30-year simulations of seasonal snow cover in 22 physically based models driven with bias-corrected meteorological reanalyses are examined at four sites with long records of snow observations. Annual snow cover durations differ widely between models, but interannual variations are strongly correlated because of the common driving data. No significant trends are observed in starting dates for seasonal snow cover, but there are significant trends towards snow cover ending earlier at two of the sites in observations and most of the models. A simplified model with just two parameters controlling solar radiation and sensible heat contributions to snowmelt spans the ranges of snow cover durations and trends. This model predicts that sites where snow persists beyond annual peaks in solar radiation and air temperature will experience rapid decreases in snow cover duration with warming as snow begins to melt earlier and at times of year with more energy available for melting.

In this paper, we characterize and compare the hydrological and thermal regimes of two subarctic headwater alpine streams within an empirical framework. The streams investigated are located within two adjacent catchments with similar geology, size, elevation and landscape, Granger Creek (GC) and Buckbrush Creek (BB), which are part of the Wolf Creek Research Basin in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Hydrometeorological and high‐resolution stream temperature data were collected throughout summer 2016. Both sites exhibited a flow regime typical of cold alpine headwater catchments influenced by frozen ground and permafrost. Comparatively, GC was characterized by a flashier response with more extreme flows, than BB. In both sites, stream temperature was highly variable and very responsive to short‐term changes in climatic conditions. On average, stream temperature in BB was slightly higher than in GC (respectively 5.8 and 5.7°C), but less variable (average difference between 75th and 25th quantiles of 1.6 and 2.0°C). Regression analysis between mean daily air and stream temperature suggested that a greater relative (to stream flow) groundwater contribution in BB could more effectively buffer atmospheric fluctuations. Heat fluxes were derived and utilized to assess their relative contribution to the energy balance. Overall, non‐advective fluxes followed a daily pattern highly correlated to short‐wave radiation. G1enerally, solar radiation and latent heat were respectively the most important heat source and sink, while air–water interface processes were major factors driving nighttime stream temperature fluctuations.</abstract><url hash="e2a8a078">2020.GWF-1.48</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13786</doi><bibkey>Fabris-etal-2020-Characterization</bibkey></paper><paper id="49"><title>A δ18O and δ2H stable water isotope analysis of subalpine forest water sources under seasonal and hydrological stress in the Canadian Rocky Mountains</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Langs</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Subalpine forests are hydrologically important to the function and health of mountain basins. Identifying the specific water sources and the proportions used by subalpine forests is necessary to understand potential impacts to these forests under a changing climate. The recent “Two Water Worlds” hypothesis suggests that trees can favour tightly bound soil water instead of readily available free‐flowing soil water. Little is known about the specific sources of water used by subalpine trees Abies lasiocarpa (Subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. In this study, stable water isotope (δ18O and δ2H) samples were obtained from S. fir and Engelmann spruce trees at three points of the growing season in combination with water sources available at time of sampling (snow, vadose zone water, saturated zone water, precipitation). Using the Bayesian Mixing Model, MixSIAR, relative source water proportions were calculated. In the drought summer examined, there was a net loss of water via evapotranspiration from the system. Results highlighted the importance of tightly vadose zone, or bound soil water, to subalpine forests, providing insights of future health under sustained years of drought and net loss in summer growing seasons. This work builds upon concepts from the “Two Water Worlds” hypothesis, showing that subalpine trees can draw from different water sources depending on season and availability. In our case, water use was largely driven by a tension gradient within the soil allowing trees to utilize vadose zone water and saturated zone water at differing points of the growing season.</abstract><url hash="95af90ee">2020.GWF-1.49</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13986</doi><bibkey>Langs-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="50"><title>Freeze–Thaw Changes of Seasonally Frozen Ground on the Tibetan Plateau from 1960 to 2014</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Luo</last></author><author><first>Jingyuan</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Lyu</last></author><abstract>The freeze–thaw changes of seasonally frozen ground (SFG) are an important indicator of climate change. Based on observed daily freeze depth of SFG from meteorological stations on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1960 to 2014, the spatial–temporal characteristics and trends in SFG were analyzed, and the relationships between them and climatic and geographical factors were explored. Freeze–thaw changes of SFG on a regional scale were assessed by multiple regression functions. Results showed multiyear mean maximum freeze depth, freeze–thaw duration, freeze start date, and thaw end date that demonstrate obvious distribution characteristics of climatic zones. A decreasing trend in maximum freeze depth and freeze–thaw duration occurred on the TP from 1960 to 2014. The freeze start date has been later, and the thaw end date has been significantly earlier. The freeze–thaw changes of SFG significantly affected by soil hydrothermal conditions on the TP could be assessed by elevation and latitude or by air temperature and precipitation, due to their high correlations. The regional average of maximum freeze depth and freeze–thaw duration caused by climatic and geographical factors were larger than those averaged using meteorological station data because most stations are located at lower altitudes. Maximum freeze depth and freeze–thaw duration have decreased sharply since 2000 on the entire TP. Warming and wetting conditions of the soil resulted in a significant decrease in maximum freeze depth and freeze–thaw duration in the most area of the TP, while drying soil results in a slight increase of them in the southeast of the TP.</abstract><url hash="f568190b">2020.GWF-1.50</url><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-19-0923.1</doi><bibkey>Luo-etal-2020-Freeze–Thaw</bibkey></paper><paper id="51"><title>Beaver dam analogue configurations influence stream and riparian water table dynamics of a degraded spring‐fed creek in the Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>T.</first><last>Munir</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract>Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are intended to simulate natural beaver dam ecohydrological functions including modifying stream hydrology and enhancing stream‐riparian hydrological connectivity. River restoration practitioners are proactively deploying BDAs in thousands of degraded streams. How various BDAs or their configurations impact stream hydrology and the riparian water table remains poorly understood. We investigated three types of BDA configurations (single, double and triple) in a spring‐fed Canadian Rocky Mountain stream over three study seasons (April–October; 2017–2019). All three BDA configurations significantly elevated the upstream stage. The deepest pools occurred upstream of the triple‐configuration BDAs (0.46 m) and the shallowest pools occurred upstream of the single‐configuration (0.36 m). Further, the single‐BDA configuration lowered stream stage and flow peaks below it but raised low flows. The double‐BDA configuration modulated flow peaks but had little influence on low flows. Unexpectedly, higher flow peaks and low flows were recorded below the triple‐BDA configuration, owing to groundwater seep. Similar to the natural beaver dam function, we observed an immediate water table rise in the riparian area after installation of the BDAs. The water table rise was greatest 2 m from the stream (0.14 m) and diminished with increasing lateral distance from the stream. Also noted was a reversal in the direction of flow between the stream and riparian area after BDA installation. Future research should further explore the dynamics of stream‐riparian hydrological connections under various BDA configurations and spacings, with the goal of identifying best practices for simulating the ecohydrological functions of natural beaver dams.</abstract><url hash="826f299d">2020.GWF-1.51</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3753</doi><bibkey>Munir-etal-2020-Beaver</bibkey></paper><paper id="52"><title>Meteorological drivers of interannual variation in transparency of mountain lakes</title><author><first>M.</first><last>H.

Consequently, transparency within a lake can vary over time due to meteorological conditions that affect hydrologic inputs. Furthermore, lake responses to these inputs may depend on catchment characteristics. We examined the relationships between meteorological conditions and interannual variation in transparency over thirteen years in a set of four lakes in Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. We measured mid-summer transparency as the attenuation coefficient of 320 nm and collected meteorological data daily with an automatic weather station located near the study lakes. Despite their close proximity, lakes varied in the strength of associations between transparency and cumulative precipitation across a range of durations. Specifically, transparency in non-glacially fed Lake Hungabee was most strongly correlated with cumulative precipitation in the fifteen days preceding sampling, whereas glacially fed Lakes Opabin and Oesa were most strongly affected by longer periods of cumulative precipitation. Consequently, there was relatively little temporal synchrony in interannual transparency variation among lakes. Our results suggest that both the timing and amount of precipitation as well local hydrology must be considered when predicting effects of climate change on mountain lake ecosystems even within a single region.</abstract><url hash="1b667827">2020.GWF-1.52</url><doi>10.1080/15230430.2020.1800972</doi><bibkey>H.

ARs are classified into southern, northern, and middle types using self-organizing maps in the ERA-Interim reanalysis and CanESM2. The southern type is associated with the development and eastward movement of anomalous lower pressure over the subtropical eastern Pacific, while the northern type is linked with the eastward movement of anomalous cyclonic circulation stimulated by warm sea surface temperatures over the subtropical western Pacific. The middle type is connected with the negative phase of North Pacific Oscillation–west Pacific teleconnection pattern. CanESM2 is further used to investigate projected AR changes at the end of the twenty-first century under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario. AR definitions usually reference fixed integrated water vapor or integrated water vapor transport thresholds. AR changes under such definitions reflect both thermodynamic and dynamic influences. We therefore also use a modified AR definition that isolates change from dynamic influences only. The total AR frequency doubles compared to the historical period, with the middle AR type contributing the largest increases along the coasts of Vancouver Island and California. Atmospheric circulation (dynamic) changes decrease northern AR type frequency while increasing middle AR type frequency, indicating that future changes of circulation patterns modify the direct effect of warming on AR frequency, which would increase ARs (relative to fixed thresholds) almost everywhere along the North American coastline.</abstract><url hash="f205dd12">2020.GWF-1.54</url><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-19-0134.1</doi><bibkey>Tan-etal-2020-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="55"><title>Multi-scale snowdrift-permitting modelling of mountain snowpack</title><author><first>V.</first><last>Vionnet</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Gascoin</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Wayand</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Shea</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Mukherjee</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The interaction of mountain terrain with meteorological processes causes substantial temporal and spatial variability in snow accumulation and ablation. Processes impacted by complex terrain include large-scale orographic enhancement of snowfall, small-scale processes such as gravitational and wind-induced transport of snow, and variability in the radiative balance such as through terrain shadowing. In this study, a multi-scale modelling approach is proposed to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of high-mountain snowpacks. The multi-scale approach combines atmospheric data from a numerical weather prediction system at the kilometre scale with process-based downscaling techniques to drive the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) at spatial resolutions allowing for explicit snow redistribution modelling. CHM permits a variable spatial resolution by using the efficient terrain representation by unstructured triangular meshes. The model simulates processes such as radiation shadowing and irradiance to slopes, blowing-snow transport (saltation and suspension) and sublimation, avalanching, forest canopy interception and sublimation, and snowpack melt. Short-term, kilometre-scale atmospheric forecasts from Environment and Climate Change Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale Model through its High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) drive CHM and are downscaled to the unstructured mesh scale. In particular, a new wind-downscaling strategy uses pre-computed wind fields from a mass-conserving wind model at 50 m resolution to perturb the mesoscale HRDPS wind and to account for the influence of topographic features on wind direction and speed. HRDPS-CHM was applied to simulate snow conditions down to 50 m resolution during winter 2017/2018 in a domain around the Kananaskis Valley (∼1000 km2) in the Canadian Rockies. Simulations were evaluated using high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) snow depth data and snow persistence indexes derived from remotely sensed imagery. Results included model falsifications and showed that both wind-induced and gravitational snow redistribution need to be simulated to capture the snowpack variability and the evolution of snow depth and persistence with elevation across the region. Accumulation of windblown snow on leeward slopes and associated snow cover persistence were underestimated in a CHM simulation driven by wind fields that did not capture lee-side flow recirculation and associated wind speed decreases. A terrain-based metric helped to identify these lee-side areas and improved the wind field and the associated snow redistribution. An overestimation of snow redistribution from windward to leeward slopes and subsequent avalanching was still found. The results of this study highlight the need for further improvements of snowdrift-permitting models for large-scale applications, in particular the representation of subgrid topographic effects on snow transport.</abstract><url hash="8502ed84">2020.GWF-1.55</url><doi>10.5194/tc-2020-187</doi><bibkey>Vionnet-etal-2020-Multi-scale</bibkey></paper><paper id="56"><title>Hydrological functioning of a beaver dam sequence and regional dam persistence during an extreme rainstorm</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Rønnquist</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Bedard-Haughn</last></author><abstract>It is becoming increasingly popular to reintroduce beaver to streams with the hopes of restoring riparian ecosystem function or reducing some of the hydrological impacts of climate change. One of the risks of relying on beaver to enhance ecosystem water storage is that their dams are reportedly more apt to fail during floods which can exacerbate flood severity. Missing are observations of beaver dam persistence and water storage capacity during floods, information needed to evaluate the risk of relying on beaver as a nature‐based flood solution. A June rainstorm in 2013 triggered the largest recorded flood in the Canadian Rocky Mountains west of Calgary, Alberta. We opportunistically recorded hydrometric data during the rainfall event at a beaver‐occupied peatland that has been studied for more than a decade. We supplemented these observations with a post‐event regional analysis of beaver dam persistence. Results do not support two long‐held hypotheses—that beaver ponds have limited flood attenuation capacity and commonly fail during large flood events. Instead we found that 68% of the beaver dam cascade systems across the region were intact or partially intact after the event. Pond fullness, in addition to the magnitude of the water‐sediment surge, emerged as important factors in determining the structural fate of dam cascade sequences. Beaver ponds at the instrumented site quickly filled in the first few hours of the rain event and levels were dynamic during the event. Water storage offered by the beaver ponds, even ones that failed, delayed downstream floodwater transmission. Study findings have important implications for reintroducing beaver as part of nature‐based restoration and climate change adaptation strategies.</abstract><url hash="1c0bbc3e">2020.GWF-1.56</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13828</doi><bibkey>Westbrook-etal-2020-Hydrological</bibkey></paper><paper id="57"><title>Predicting Variable Contributing Areas, Hydrological Connectivity, and Solute Transport Pathways for a Canadian Prairie Basin</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Costa</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Shook</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>In cold agricultural regions, seasonal snowmelt over frozen soils provides the primary source of runoff and transports large nutrient loads downstream.

Results found corroboration across the knowledge systems that operation of dams has lowered summer flows and created unnaturally high winter flows. The knowledge systems, however, diverged in some areas, such as the production of northern pike, where local residents observed abundant pike but records showed the pike commercial harvest declining to near zero.

Most conventional sensing systems either can only monitor one parameter at a time or lack user-friendly on-site monitoring capabilities. A fully integrated electrochemical sensors array is an excellent solution to this barrier. Electrochemical sensing methods involve transduction of water quality parameters where chemical interactions are converted to electrical signals. The challenge remains in designing low-cost, easy-to-use and highly sensitive sensors array that can continuously monitor major water quality parameters such as pH, free chlorine, temperature along with emerging pharmaceutical contaminants and heavy-metal without the use of expensive laboratory based techniques and trained personnel. Here, we overcame this challenge through realizing a fully-integrated electrochemical sensing system that offers simultaneous monitoring of pH (57.5 mV/pH), free chlorine (186 nA/ppm), and temperature (16.9 mV/°C); and on-demand monitoring of acetaminophen and 17β-estradiol (&lt;10 nM), and heavy-metal (&lt;10 ppb) - bridging the technological gap between signal transduction, processing, wireless-transmission and smartphone interfacing. This was achieved by merging nanomaterials, and carbon nanotubes based sensors fabricated on microscope glass slides controlled by a custom-designed readout circuit, a potentiostat and an Android app. The sensing system can be easily modified and programmed to integrate other sensors, a capability that can be exploited to monitor a range of water quality parameters.

Cold region hydrology is very sensitive to the impacts of climate warming.
Impacts of warming over recent decades in western Canada include glacier
retreat, permafrost thaw, and changing patterns of precipitation, with an
increased proportion of winter precipitation falling as rainfall and shorter durations of snow cover, as well as consequent changes in flow regimes. Future warming is expected to continue along these lines. Physically realistic and
sophisticated hydrological models driven by reliable climate forcing can
provide the capability to assess hydrological responses to climate change.
However, the provision of reliable forcing data remains problematic,
particularly in data-sparse regions. Hydrological processes in cold regions
involve complex phase changes and so are very sensitive to small biases in
the driving meteorology, particularly in temperature and precipitation,
including precipitation phase. Cold regions often have sparse surface
observations, particularly at high elevations that generate a large amount
of runoff. This paper aims to provide an improved set of forcing data for
large-scale hydrological models for climate change impact assessment. The
best available gridded data in Canada are from the high-resolution forecasts
of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) atmospheric model and outputs
of the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA), but these datasets have a
short historical record. The EU WATCH ERA-Interim reanalysis (WFDEI) has a
longer historical record but has often been found to be biased relative to
observations over Canada. The aim of this study, therefore, is to blend the
strengths of both datasets (GEM-CaPA and WFDEI) to produce a less-biased
long-record product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) for hydrological modelling and climate
change impact assessment over the Mackenzie River Basin. First, a
multivariate generalization of the quantile mapping technique was
implemented to bias-correct WFDEI against GEM-CaPA at 3 h × 0.125 ∘ resolution during the 2005–2016 overlap period, followed by a
hindcast of WFDEI-GEM-CaPA from 1979. The derived WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data are
validated against station observations as a preliminary step to assess their
added value. This product is then used to bias-correct climate projections
from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Canadian
Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) between 1950 and 2100 under RCP8.5, and an
analysis of the datasets shows that the biases in the original WFDEI product
have been removed and the climate change signals in CanRCM4 are preserved.
The resulting bias-corrected datasets are a consistent set of historical and
climate projection data suitable for large-scale modelling and future
climate scenario analysis. The final historical product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA,
1979–2016) is freely available at the Federated Research Data Repository at

Characterizing how DOM composition evolves along the aquatic continuum can be difficult. Using a size-exclusion chromatography technique (LC-OCD), we assessed the variability in DOM composition from both surface and groundwaters across a number of Canadian ecozones (mean annual temperature spanning −10 to +6 C). A wide range in DOM concentration was found from 0.2 to 120 mg C/L. Proportions of different size-based groupings across ecozones were variable, yet similarities between specific water-body types, regardless of location, suggest commonality in the processes dictating the evolution of DOM composition. A principal-component analysis identified 70% of the variation in LC-OCD derived DOM compositions could be explained by the water-body type. We find that water-body type has a greater influence on DOM composition than differences in climate or surrounding vegetation.

Seasonality leads to different hydrological processes dominating at different times of the year, which translates to time variant sensitivity in model parameters. In this study, Hydrological Predictions for the Environment model (HYPE) is set up in the NCRB to analyze the time variant sensitivity analysis (TVSA) of model parameters using a Global Sensitivity Analysis technique known as Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS). TVSA can identify parameters that are highly influential in a short period but relatively uninfluential over the whole simulation period. TVSA is generally effective in identifying model’s sensitivity to event-based parameters related to cold region processes such as snowmelt and frozen soil. This can guide event-based calibration, useful for operational flood forecasting. In contrast to residual based metrics, flow signatures, specifically the slope of the mid-segment of the flow duration curve, allows VARS to detect the influential parameters throughout the timescale of analysis. The results are beneficial for the calibration process in complex and multi-dimensional models by targeting the informative parameters, which are associated with the cold region hydrological processes.</abstract><url hash="4021df6b">2020.GWF-1.67</url><doi>10.3390/w12040961</doi><bibkey>Bajracharya-etal-2020-Time</bibkey></paper><paper id="68"><title>Heterogeneity of the peat profile and its role in unsaturated sodium chloride rise at field and laboratory scales</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Balliston</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Price</last></author><abstract>Resource extraction in Canada's boreal ecozone increases the risk of contaminant release into the area's extensive bog and fen peatlands. Lateral spreading, then upwards transport of solutes into the vadose zone of these moss‐dominated ecosystems, could be toxic to vegetation. To evaluate the rate and character of contaminant rise in a subarctic bog, vadose zone‐specific conductance and water content were measured in four hummocks ∼5 m downslope of a 45‐d 300‐mg L−1 NaCl release. Four 30‐cm‐deep hummock peat mesocosms were extracted adjacent to the release site for an unsaturated evaporation‐driven NaCl breakthrough experiment and subsequent parameterization. The field rate of solute accumulation was slower in near‐surface (0–5 cm) peat, where low water contents limited pore connectivity. Solute accumulation was reduced by downward flushing by rain, though this was lesser in near surface moss where solute remained held in small disconnected pores. In the laboratory, Cl− rise reached the 15‐cm depth in all mesocosms by Day 65. Sodium rise was 2.2 times slower, likely due to adsorption to the peat matrix. Rates of upwards solute movement were highly variable; the highest rates occurred in the mesocosm with small but hydrologically conductive pores near the surface, and the lowest occurred where vascular roots disrupted the physical structure of the peat. This research demonstrates that solute spilled into a bog peatland is likely to rise and be retained in the vadose zone. However, hydraulic and solute transport behaviors are sensitive to the vertical structure of peat, underscoring the need for extensive sampling and parameter characterization.</abstract><url hash="d09ec2fa">2020.GWF-1.68</url><doi>10.1002/vzj2.20015</doi><bibkey>Balliston-etal-2020-Heterogeneity</bibkey></paper><paper id="69"><title>No beating around the bush: the impact of projected high-latitude vegetation transitions on soil and ecosystem respiration.</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><abstract>Globally, ecosystem respiration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the second largest terrestrial carbon (C) flux after photosynthesis (Mahecha et al., 2010). Soil respiration is the main contributor to ecosystem respiration (e.g. c. 70% in temperate forests; reviewed in Ryan &amp; Law, 2005). Plants shunt tremendous quantities of newly photosynthesized C belowground for storage in their roots but also to support rootmetabolism, root exudate production, and resource trading with root symbionts, most notably mycorrhizas (Raich &amp; Nadelhoffer, 1989). These latter C end-points result in newly-fixed C being respired by roots or their symbionts or becoming substrate for use by free-living soil microorganisms. The respiration of this new photosynthetic C can occur within a few days to a month or two after fixation and can contribute to &gt; 50% of the soil respiration (H€ogberg et al., 2001). Plants allocate photosynthetic C differentially aboveground and belowground depending on resource limitation and the demands of the mutualists with whom they collaborate, suggesting that this contribution to soil respiration may vary. As such, both belowground and aboveground vegetation composition, structure, function, and mutualistic partnerships are quite important for determining soil and thus ecosystem respiration.

While code clones are not always harmful, they can have a detrimental effect on the overall quality of a software system due to the propagation of bugs and other maintenance implications. Because of this, software developers need to analyse the code clones that exist in a software system. However, despite the availability of several clone detection systems, the adoption of such tools outside of the clone community remains low. A possible reason for this is the difficulty and complexity involved in setting up and using these tools. In this paper, we present Clone Swarm, a code clone analytics tool that identifies clones in a project and presents the information in an easily accessible manner. Clone Swarm is publicly available and can mine any open-sourced GIT repository. Clone Swarm internally uses NiCad, a popular clone detection tool in the cloud and lets users interactively explore code clones using a web-based interface at multiple granularity levels (Function and Block level). Clone results are visualized in multiple overviews, all the way from a high-level plot down to an individual line by line comparison view of cloned fragments. Also, to facilitate future research in the area of clone detection and analysis, users can directly download the clone detection results for their projects. Clone Swarm is available online at clone-swarm.usask.ca.

Operational frequency and intensity estimates are very often obtained from generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions fitted to samples of annual maxima. GEV distributed random variables are “max-stable,” meaning that the maximum of a sample of several values drawn from a given GEV distribution is again GEV distributed with the same shape parameter. Long-period return value estimation relies on this property of the distribution. The data to which the models are fitted may not, however, be max-stable. Observational records are generally too short to assess whether max-stability holds in the upper tail of the observations. Large ensemble climate simulations, from which we can obtain very large samples of annual extremes, provide an opportunity to assess whether max-stability holds in a model-simulated climate and to quantify the impact of the lack of max-stability on very long period return-level estimates. We use a recent large ensemble simulation of the North American climate for this purpose. We find that the annual maxima of short-duration precipitation extremes tend not to be max-stable in the simulated climate, as indicated by systematic variation in the estimated shape parameter as block length is increased from 1 to 20 years. We explore how the lack of max-stability affects the estimation of very long period return levels and discuss reasons why short-duration precipitation extremes may not be max-stable.</abstract><url hash="5e572a33">2020.GWF-1.73</url><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-19-0011.1</doi><bibkey>B.

These characteristics are: clear goals, adequate preparation, appropriate methods: scientific rigor and community engagement, significant results/impact, effective presentation/dissemination, reflective critique, leadership and personal contribution, and consistently ethical behavior. These are then applied to a non-peer reviewed work that describes the cumulative effects of environmental change for people in the Slave River Delta Region of the North West Territories, Canada. The reader is asked to view Delta Ways Remembered, a 13-minute video employing an enhanced e-storytelling technique to share and disseminate traditional knowledge about the delta from a compendium of people as a single-voiced narrative. The purpose is to highlight the scholarship underlying non-traditional academic expositions not readily assessed under current paradigms of academic evaluation. This essay strives to illustrate how Jordan’s characteristics can be applied to evaluate non-peer reviewed scholarly work, and also to share rewards and challenges associated with the harmonious blending of Indigenous and western knowledge addressing societal/environmental issues identified by the Indigenous community.</abstract><url hash="b7348f06">2020.GWF-1.75</url><doi>10.15402/esj.v5i3.70365</doi><bibkey>Bharadwaj-etal-2020-Tenets</bibkey></paper><paper id="76"><title>An Exploratory Study to Find Motives Behind Cross-platform Forks from Software Heritage Dataset</title><author><first>Avijit</first><last>Bhattacharjee</last></author><author><first>Sristy</first><last>Sumana Nath</last></author><author><first>Shurui</first><last>Zhou</last></author><author><first>Debasish</first><last>Chakroborti</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Currently, multiple social coding platforms support fork-based development, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Although these different platforms virtually share the same features, they have different emphasis. As GitHub is the most popular platform and the corresponding data is publicly available, most of the current studies are focusing on GitHub hosted projects. However, we observed anecdote evidences that people are confused about choosing among these platforms, and some projects are migrating from one platform to another, and the reasons behind these activities remain unknown. With the advances of Software Heritage Graph Dataset (SWHGD), we have the opportunity to investigate the forking activities across platforms. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on 10 popular open-source projects to identify cross-platform forks and investigate the motivation behind. Preliminary result shows that cross-platform forks do exist. For the 10 subject systems used in this study, we found 81,357 forks in total among which 179 forks are on GitLab. Based on our qualitative analysis, we found that most of the cross-platform forks that we identified are mirrors of the repositories on another platform, but we still find cases that were created due to preference of using certain functionalities (e.g. Continuous Integration (CI)) supported by different platforms. This study lays the foundation of future research directions, such as understanding the differences between platforms and supporting cross-platform collaboration.</abstract><url hash="2e3ddebc">2020.GWF-1.76</url><doi>10.1145/3379597.3387512</doi><bibkey>Bhattacharjee-etal-2020-An</bibkey></paper><paper id="77"><title>The role of snow processes and hillslopes on runoff generation in present and future climates in a recently constructed watershed in the Athabasca oil sands region</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Biagi</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Carey</last></author><abstract>Mine reclamation in the Athabasca oil sands region Canada, is required by law where companies must reconstruct disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and lakes that existed in the Boreal landscape prior to mining. Winter is a major hydrological factor in this region as snow covers the landscape for 5–6 months and is ~25% of the annual precipitation, yet few studies have explored the influence of winter processes on the hydrology of constructed watersheds. One year (2017–2018) of intensive snow hydrology measurements are supplemented with 6 years (2013–2018) of meteorological measurements from the constructed Sandhill Fen watershed to: (a) understand snow accumulation and redistribution, snowmelt timing, rate, and partitioning, (b) apply a physically based model for simulating winter processes on hillslopes, and (c) evaluate the impact of soil prescriptions and climate change projections on winter processes in reclaimed systems. The 2017–2018 snow season was between November and April and snow water equivalent (SWE) ranged between 40 and 140 mm. Snow distribution was primarily influenced by topography with little influence of snow trapping from developing vegetation. Snow accumulation was most variable on hillslopes and redistribution was driven by slope position, with SWE greatest at the base of slopes and decreased toward crests. Snowmelt on hillslopes was controlled by slope aspect, as snow declined rapidly on west and south‐facing slopes, compared with east and north‐facing slopes. Unlike results previously reported on constructed uplands, snowmelt runoff from uplands was much less (~30%), highlighting the influence of different construction materials. Model simulations indicate that antecedent soil moisture and soil temperature have a large influence on partitioning snowmelt over a range of observed conditions. Under a warmer and wetter climate, average annual peak SWE, and snow season duration could decline up to 52% and up to 61 days, respectively, while snowmelt runoff ceases completely under the warmest scenarios. Results suggest considerable future variability in snowmelt runoff from hillslopes, yet soil properties can be used to enhance vertical or lateral flows.</abstract><url hash="593aee2a">2020.GWF-1.77</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13836</doi><bibkey>Biagi-etal-2020-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="78"><title>Assessing the state of the art in Discrete Global Grid Systems: OGC criteria and present functionality</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Bondaruk</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Roberts</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Robertson</last></author><abstract>The continuous growth of available geospatial data requires new methods for its integration, analysis, and visualization to be explored and implemented in software available to the geospatial commu...</abstract><url hash="c985f3bb">2020.GWF-1.78</url><doi>10.1139/geomat-2019-0015</doi><bibkey>Bondaruk-etal-2020-Assessing</bibkey></paper><paper id="79"><title>Testing hypothetical bias in a framed field experiment</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Tarfasa</last></author><abstract>Hypothetical bias is tested based on inter- and intra-respondent comparisons of choice behavior, applying a hypothetical and real choice experiment. The inter-respondent comparison commonly applied in the environmental and agricultural economics literature consists of a control group of buyers who are asked to hypothetically choose between conventional and organic beans and an experimental group of buyers who are endowed to purchase the same beans using an identical experimental design. Hypothetical bias is tested by comparing inter- and intra-respondents’ (i) hypothetical and real choices, (ii) preference parameters of the estimated choice models related to hypothetical and real choices, and (iii) hypothetical and real willingness to pay (WTP). Choices in the experimental group are highly consistent when switching from hypothetical to real choices for this study's homegrown goods. However, after being endowed, the price sensitivity of lower income households drops, suggesting a house money effect. WTP derived from actual purchases is higher than WTP based on hypothetical choices, indicating a negative hypothetical bias, but differences are only significant in the case of the inter-respondent comparison. Actual prices paid by respondents in the field experiment appear to be considerably lower than the estimated WTP values and yield a mixed picture of hypothetical bias.</abstract><url hash="be82c32d">2020.GWF-1.79</url><doi>10.1111/cjag.12224</doi><bibkey>Brouwer-etal-2020-Testing</bibkey></paper><paper id="80"><title>Structural calibration of an semi-distributed hydrological model of the Liard River basin</title><author><first>Genevieve</first><last>Brown</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Craig</last></author><abstract>Abstract The development of hydrological models that produce practically useful and physically defensible results is an ongoing challenge in hydrology. This challenge is further compounded in large, spatially variable basins with sparse data, where a detailed understanding of a basin’s hydrological response may be limited. This study presents an iterative and stepwise calibration strategy for model structure and parameters for a hydrological model of the 275,000 km2 Liard River basin in northern Canada. The calibration procedure was optimized to exploit and represent available data at 29 stream gauges and included the use of multiple data sources to constrain model calibration and improve model function. A flexible modelling framework was used to allow the explicit inclusion of locally varied model structure within the calibration procedure. The final model exhibits strong performance in both calibration and validation, and represents significantly different hydrological responses in different portions of the basin well. The calibration procedure helped to identify differences in hydrological processes within the basin which have not been considered by other models of the Liard. The ability to modify model structure in order to account for different hydrological regimes in different parts of the basin is demonstrated to improve model performance locally and globally.</abstract><url hash="40c66746">2020.GWF-1.80</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2020.1803143</doi><bibkey>Brown-etal-2020-Structural</bibkey></paper><paper id="81"><title>Towards indigenous community-led monitoring of fish in the oil sands region of Canada: Lessons at the intersection of cultural consensus and fish science</title><author><first>Nicolas</first><last>D.

Several models (from simple conceptual to advanced process-based) are available, but the focus has been largely in reproducing streamflow. Few studies have assimilated soil moisture and other hydrological fluxes for improved simulation, but the emphasis has been predominately on simulating contributing areas. However, previous research has shown that the contributing areas are dynamic, and can vary from one year to the next, depending on hydro-meteorological conditions. Therefore, the areas deemed non-contributing can also occasionally contribute to streamflow. In this study, we introduce a progressive two-stage calibration strategy to constrain soil moisture in non-contributing areas. We demonstrate that constraining soil moisture in non-contributing areas can result in improved hydrological simulations and more realistic process representations. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for simulated soil moisture in contributing areas increased by 68% at 20 cm and 25% at 50 cm soil depths during validation when noncontributing areas were constrained. This further led to increases in NSE values in streamflow simulation during calibration (6%) and validation (12%). Our findings suggest that soil moisture in non-contributing areas should be properly constrained for improved modelling of Prairie catchments.

Limited studies have been performed on constraining the model parameters, despite the fact that the presence of a large number of parameters may provide large degree of freedom, resulting in equifinality and poor model performance. In this study, a multi-objective optimization approach is adopted, and both streamflow and soil moisture data are calibrated simultaneously for an experimental study basin in the Saskatchewan Prairies in western Canada. The results of this study show that the multi-objective calibration improves model fidelity compared to the single objective calibration. Moreover, the study demonstrates that single objective calibration performed against only streamflow can fairly mimic the streamflow hydrograph but does not yield realistic estimation of other fluxes such as evapotranspiration and soil moisture (especially in deeper soil layers).</abstract><url hash="47aba35f">2020.GWF-1.84</url><doi>10.1080/02626667.2020.1715982</doi><bibkey>Budhathoki-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="85"><title>Field tests of an improved sediment tracer including non‐intrusive measurement of burial depth</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Cain</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>MacVicar</last></author><abstract>Radio‐frequency identification (RFID) transponders are now widely used to track sediment in a variety of environments. A recent innovation placed the transponder inside of a rotating inner mechanism that is designed to minimize missed detections due to burial and shielding or ‘signal collision’ effects between tracers, while also allowing a rapid measurement of the burial depth of the particle. Here we test a developed protocol for burial depth measurement and deploy the ‘Wobblestone’ tracers in the field for the first time. Results show that new tracers can be reliably positioned in the horizontal plane (median error ± 0.03 m) and that the burial depth can be accurately measured (~0.02 m maximum error). The field study was characterized by high mobility and travel lengths, and ~20% of the tracers were buried at depths up to 0.15 m. A comparison of exponential distributions for travel length of surface deposited and buried tracers indicate that the buried tracers on average traveled farther and earlier in the flood event. Tracers that did not move were also buried at one site as a result of sediment transport from upstream.

The Gardiner Dam, one of the structures that forms the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir located in the Canadian Prairies, is managed for hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation and is known to have widely altering temperature regimes and nutrient circulations. This study applies the hydrodynamic and nutrient CE-QUAL-W2 model to explore how various withdrawal depths (5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 m) influence the concentrations and distribution of nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) within the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir. As expected, the highest dissolved nutrient (phosphate, PO43−-P and nitrate, NO3−-N) concentrations were associated with hypoxic depth horizons in both studied years. During summer high flow period spillway operations impact the distribution of nutrients, water temperatures, and DO as increased epilimnion flow velocities route the incoming water through the surface of the reservoir and reduce mixing and surface warming. This reduces reservoir concentrations but can lead to increased outflow nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. Lower withdrawal elevations pull warmer surface water deeper within the reservoir and decrease reservoir DO during summer stratification. During fall turnover low outflow elevations increase water column mixing and draws warmer water deeper, leading to slightly higher temperatures and nutrient concentrations than shallow withdrawal elevations. The 15 m depth (540 m above sea level) outflow generally provided the best compromise for overall reservoir and outflow nutrient reduction.</abstract><url hash="a9a5c273">2020.GWF-1.86</url><doi>10.1089/ees.2019.0146</doi><bibkey>Carr-etal-2020-Impacts</bibkey></paper><paper id="87"><title>Impacts of Predicting the Liquid Fraction of Mixed-Phase Particles on the Simulation of an Extreme Freezing Rain Event: The 1998 North American Ice Storm</title><author><first>Mélissa</first><last>Cholette</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Milbrandt</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Morrison</last></author><abstract>
 A prognostic equation for the liquid fraction of mixed-phase particles has been recently added to the Predicted Particle Properties (P3) bulk microphysics scheme. Mixed-phase particles are necessary to simulate key microphysical processes leading to various winter precipitation types, such as ice pellets and freezing rain. To illustrate the impacts of predicting the bulk liquid fraction, the 1998 North American Ice Storm is simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model with the modified P3 scheme. It is found that simulating partial melting by predicting the bulk liquid fraction produces higher mass and number mixing ratios of rain. This leads to smaller rain sizes reaching the refreezing layer as well as a decrease in the freezing rain accumulation at the surface by up to 30% in some locations compared to when no liquid fraction is predicted. The increase in fall speed and density and decrease of particle diameter during partial melting combined with an improved representation of the refreezing process in the modified P3 leads to generally higher total solid surface precipitation rates than using the original P3 scheme. There is also an increase of solid precipitation in regions of ice pellet accumulation. Overall, the simulation of mixed-phase particles notably impacts the vertical and spatial distributions of precipitation properties.</abstract><url hash="dea2f2e5">2020.GWF-1.87</url><doi>10.1175/mwr-d-20-0026.1</doi><bibkey>Cholette-etal-2020-Impacts</bibkey></paper><paper id="88"><title>Metals and PFAS in stormwater and surface runoff in a semi-arid Canadian city subject to large variations in temperature among seasons</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Codling</last></author><author><first>Hong-Wei</first><last>Yuan</last></author><author><first>Paul</first><last>D.

The identities and functions of extremophile fungi present after fire can influence C dynamics, particularly because plant-fungal relationships are often species-specific. However, little is known about the function and distribution of fungi that survive fires. We aim to assess the distribution of heat-resistant soil fungi across burned stands of boreal forest in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and understand their functions in relation to decomposition and tree seedling growth. We cultured and identified fungi from heat-treated soils and linked sequences from known taxa with high throughput sequencing fungal data (Illumina MiSeq, ITS1) from soils collected in 47 plots. We assessed functions under controlled conditions by inoculating litter and seedlings with heat-resistant fungi to assess decomposition and effects on seedling growth, respectively, for black spruce (Picea mariana), birch (Betula papyrifera), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). We also measured litter decomposition rates and seedling densities in the field without inoculation. We isolated seven taxa of heat-resistant fungi and found their relative abundances were not associated with environmental or fire characteristics. Under controlled conditions, Fayodia gracilipes and Penicillium arenicola decomposed birch, but no taxa decomposed black spruce litter significantly more than the control treatment. Seedlings showed reduced biomass and/or mortality when inoculated with at least one of the fungal taxa. Penicillium turbatum reduced growth and/or caused mortality of all three species of seedlings. In the field, birch litter decomposed faster in stands with greater pre-fire proportion of black spruce, while black spruce litter decomposed faster in stands experiencing longer fire-free intervals. Densities of seedlings that had germinated since fire were positively associated with ectomycorrhizal richness while there were fewer conifer seedlings with greater heat-resistant fungal abundance. Overall, our study suggests that extremophile fungi present after fires have multiple functions and may have unexpected negative effects on forest functioning and regeneration. In particular, heat-resistant fungi after fires may promote shifts away from conifer dominance that are observed in these boreal forests.</abstract><url hash="2eda6691">2020.GWF-1.91</url><doi>10.3389/ffgc.2020.00068</doi><bibkey>J.

Ecography published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Nordic Society Oikos Climate change is altering disturbance regimes outside historical norms, which can impact biodiversity by selecting for plants with particular traits. The relative impact of disturbance characteristics on plant traits and community structure may be mediated by environmental gradients. We aimed to understand how wildfire impacted understory plant communities and plant regeneration strategies along gradients of environmental conditions and wildfire characteristics in boreal forests. We established 207 plots (60 m2) in recently burned stands and 133 plots in mature stands with no recent fire history in comparable gradients of stand type, site moisture (drainage) and soil organic layer (SOL) depth in two ecozones in Canada's Northwest Territories. At each plot, we recorded all vascular plant taxa in the understory and measured the regeneration strategy (seeder, resprouter, survivor) in burned plots, along with seedbed conditions (mineral soil and bryophyte cover). Dispersal, longevity and growth form traits were determined for each taxon. Fire characteristics measured included proportion of pre-fire SOL combusted (fire severity), date of burn (fire seasonality) and pre-fire stand age (time following fire). Results showed understory community composition was altered by fire. However, burned and mature stands had similar plant communities in wet sites with deep SOL. In the burned plots, regeneration strategies were determined by fire severity, drainage and pre- and post-fire SOL depth. Resprouters were more common in wet sites with deeper SOL and lower fire severity, while seeders were associated with drier sites with thinner SOL and greater fire severity. This led to drier burned stands being compositionally different from their mature counterparts and seedbed conditions were important. Our study highlights the importance of environment–wildfire interactions in shaping plant regeneration strategies and patterns of understory plant community structure across landscapes, and the overriding importance of SOL depth and site drainage in mediating fire severity, plant regeneration and community structure.</abstract><url hash="b7d3372b">2020.GWF-1.92</url><doi>10.1111/ecog.05211</doi><bibkey>J.

Treed peatlands have previously received little attention with regard to wildfire management; however, their role in fire spread, and the contribution of peat smouldering to dangerous air pollution, have recently been highlighted. To help develop effective wildfire management techniques in treed peatlands, we use seismic line disturbance as an analog for peatland fuel modification treatments. To delineate below-ground hydrocarbon resources using seismic waves, seismic lines are created by removing above-ground (canopy) fuels using heavy machinery, forming linear disturbances through some treed peatlands. We found significant differences in moisture content and peat bulk density with depth between seismic line and undisturbed plots, where smouldering combustion potential was lower in seismic lines. Sphagnum mosses dominated seismic lines and canopy fuel load was reduced for up to 55 years compared to undisturbed peatlands. Sphagnum mosses had significantly lower smouldering potential than feather mosses (that dominate mature, undisturbed peatlands) in a laboratory drying experiment, suggesting that fuel modification treatments following a strategy based on seismic line analogs would be effective at reducing smouldering potential at the WSI, especially under increasing fire weather.</abstract><url hash="c0d407bd">2020.GWF-1.93</url><doi>10.3390/fire3020021</doi><bibkey>Deane-etal-2020-Seismic</bibkey></paper><paper id="94"><title>Differential responses of gut microbiota of male and female fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to a short-term environmentally-relevant, aqueous exposure to benzo[a]pyrene.</title><author><first>Abigail</first><last>DeBofsky</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>Chelsea</first><last>Grimard</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>J.

Previous work on GSA, however, has typically been under the assumption that the controlling factors such as model inputs and parameters are independent, whereas, in many cases, they are correlated and their joint distribution follows a variety of forms. Although this assumption can limit the credibility of GSA and its results, very few studies in the field of water and environmental modeling address this issue. In this paper, we first discuss the significance of correlation effects in GSA and then propose a new GSA framework for properly accounting for correlations in input/parameter spaces. To this end, we extend the “variogram‐based” theory of GSA, called variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS), and develop a new generalized star sampling technique (called gSTAR) to accommodate correlated multivariate distributions. We test the new gSTAR‐VARS method on two test functions, against a state‐of‐the‐art GSA method that handles correlation effects. We then apply gSTAR‐VARS to the HBV‐SASK model, calibrated via a Bayesian, Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, for design flood estimation in the Oldman River Basin in Canada. Results demonstrate that accounting for correlation effects can be critically important in GSA, especially in the presence of nonlinearity and interaction effects in the underlying response surfaces. The proposed method can efficiently handle correlations and different distribution types and simultaneously generate a range of sensitivity indices, such as total‐variogram effects, variance‐based total‐order effects, and derivative‐based elementary effects.</abstract><url hash="b0bef332">2020.GWF-1.96</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR025436</doi><bibkey>Do-etal-2020-Correlation</bibkey></paper><paper id="97"><title>The economic impacts of water supply restrictions due to climate and policy change: A transboundary river basin supply-side input-output analysis</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Eamen</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract /><url hash="c7b9c3a4">2020.GWF-1.97</url><doi>10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106532</doi><bibkey>Eamen-etal-2020-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="98"><title>On the configuration and initialization of a large-scale hydrological land surface model to represent permafrost</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Princz</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Sapriza-Azuri</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Abdelhamed</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Pietroniro</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Permafrost is an important feature of cold-region hydrology, particularly in
river basins such as the Mackenzie River basin (MRB), and it needs to be
properly represented in hydrological and land surface models (H-LSMs) built
into existing Earth system models (ESMs), especially under the unprecedented
climate warming trends that have been observed. Higher rates of warming have
been reported in high latitudes compared to the global average, resulting in
permafrost thaw with wide-ranging implications for hydrology and feedbacks
to climate. The current generation of H-LSMs is being improved to simulate
permafrost dynamics by allowing deep soil profiles and incorporating organic
soils explicitly. Deeper soil profiles have larger hydraulic and thermal
memories that require more effort to initialize. This study aims to devise a
robust, yet computationally efficient, initialization and parameterization
approach applicable to regions where data are scarce and simulations
typically require large computational resources. The study further
demonstrates an upscaling approach to inform large-scale ESM simulations
based on the insights gained by modelling at small scales. We used
permafrost observations from three sites along the Mackenzie River valley
spanning different permafrost classes to test the validity of the approach.
Results show generally good performance in reproducing present-climate
permafrost properties at the three sites. The results also emphasize the
sensitivity of the simulations to the soil layering scheme used, the depth
to bedrock, and the organic soil properties.</abstract><url hash="5706de35">2020.GWF-1.98</url><doi>10.5194/HESS-24-349-2020</doi><bibkey>Elshamy-etal-2020-On</bibkey></paper><paper id="99"><title>Underlying Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering for River Network Modeling</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Emery</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>David</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Andreadis</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Turmon</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Reager</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Hobbs</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Pan</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Beighley</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Rodell</last></author><abstract>The grand challenge of producing hydrometeorological estimates every time and everywhere has motivated the fusion of sparse observations with dense numerical models, with a particular interest on discharge in river modeling. Ensemble methods are largely preferred as they enable the estimation of error properties, but at the expense of computational load and generally with underestimations. These imperfect stochastic estimates motivate the use of correction methods, that is, error localization and inflation, although the physical justifications for their optimality are limited. The purpose of this study is to use one of the simplest forms of data assimilation when applied to river modeling and reveal the underlying mechanisms impacting its performance. Our framework based on assimilating daily averaged in situ discharge measurements to correct daily averaged runoff was tested over a 4-yr case study of two rivers in Texas. Results show that under optimal conditions of inflation and localization, discharge simulations are consistently improved such that the mean values of Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency are enhanced from −11.32 to 0.55 at observed gauges and from −12.24 to −1.10 at validation gauges. Yet, parameters controlling the inflation and the localization have a large impact on the performance. Further investigations of these sensitivities showed that optimal inflation occurs when compensating exactly for discrepancies in the magnitude of errors while optimal localization matches the distance traveled during one assimilation window. These results may be applicable to more advanced data assimilation methods as well as for larger applications motivated by upcoming river-observing satellite missions, such as NASA’s Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission.</abstract><url hash="2001eea3">2020.GWF-1.99</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-19-0084.1</doi><bibkey>Emery-etal-2020-Underlying</bibkey></paper><paper id="100"><title>Characterization of the hydraulic conductivity of glacial till aquitards</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Ferris</last></author><author><first>Greg</first><last>A.

This is the case even in water‐rich regions, where upward swings in water demands during periods of hot, dry weather can aggravate already strained water supplies and increase cities' vulnerability to water shortage. Summer spikes in water demand have motivated several cities to impose permanent restrictions on outdoor water uses; however, little is yet known about their effectiveness. This paper examines daily water production data from 15 Canadian cities to (1) quantify how overall and seasonal demands are evolving over time across humid and semiarid settings and (2) determine whether permanent water use restrictions have been effective in curbing summer water demands both seasonally and during specific hot and dry periods. Results show that while per‐capita water demand is declining in all cities studied, the seasonal distribution of that demand has remained largely stable in all but a few cases. While average demands in the summer months remain largely unaffected by the imposition of permanent restrictions, cities that enforce stringent limits on outdoor water use have seen a reduction in the variability of daily demands and a decline in peak demands following their implementation. During short‐term periods of exceptionally hot and dry weather when vulnerability to water shortage is most acute, cities with strict restrictions also see smaller surges in demand than those with weaker or no restrictions in place.</abstract><url hash="13f2f6fa">2020.GWF-1.101</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR026466</doi><bibkey>Finley-etal-2020-Curbing</bibkey></paper><paper id="102"><title>Many Commonly Used Rainfall‐Runoff Models Lack Long, Slow Dynamics: Implications for Runoff Projections</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Fowler</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Knoben</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Peel</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Peterson</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Ryu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Saft</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Seo</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Western</last></author><abstract>Evidence suggests that catchment state variables such as groundwater can exhibit multiyear trends. This means that their state may reflect not only recent climatic conditions but also climatic conditions in past years or even decades. Here we demonstrate that five commonly used conceptual “bucket” rainfall‐runoff models are unable to replicate multiyear trends exhibited by natural systems during the “Millennium Drought” in south‐east Australia. This causes an inability to extrapolate to different climatic conditions, leading to poor performance in split sample tests. Simulations are examined from five models applied in 38 catchments, then compared with groundwater data from 19 bores and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data for two geographic regions. Whereas the groundwater and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data decrease from high to low values gradually over the duration of the 13‐year drought, the model storages go from high to low values in a typical seasonal cycle. This is particularly the case in the drier, flatter catchments. Once the drought begins, there is little room for decline in the simulated storage, because the model “buckets” are already “emptying” on a seasonal basis. Since the effects of sustained dry conditions cannot accumulate within these models, we argue that they should not be used for runoff projections in a drying climate. Further research is required to (a) improve conceptual rainfall‐runoff models, (b) better understand circumstances in which multiyear trends in state variables occur, and (c) investigate links between these multiyear trends and changes in rainfall‐runoff relationships in the context of a changing climate.</abstract><url hash="8afba740">2020.GWF-1.102</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR025286</doi><bibkey>Fowler-etal-2020-Many</bibkey></paper><paper id="103"><title>A multiregional input–output optimization model to assess impacts of water supply disruptions under climate change on the Great Lakes economy</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Garcia-Hernandez</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><abstract>This paper presents a water-restricted multi-regional input–output model to evaluate the economic impacts of water supply reductions in the Canadian Great Lakes Basin (GLB), one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in the world. The proposed model, first of its kind applied to the GLB, aims to minimize the impact of water supply disruptions on the GLB-economy, measured by the loss of GDP. A new flexible economic optimization procedure is introduced, capable of imposing resource constraints and ensuring minimal supply levels for intermediate and final consumption at the same time. The model accounts for inter-regional trade between different lake regions. The impacts of two climate change scenarios on water security and the economy are investigated, with and without additional food and energy security restrictions.

their process-oriented representation of water and energy fluxes. A priori
specification of the grid size of the land models is typically defined based
on the spatial resolution of forcing data, the modeling objectives, the
available geospatial information, and computational resources. The
variability of the inputs, soil types, vegetation covers, and forcing is
masked or aggregated based on the a priori grid size. In this study, we propose an
alternative vector-based implementation to directly configure a land model
using unique combinations of land cover types, soil types, and other desired
geographical features that have hydrological significance, such as elevation
zone, slope, and aspect. The main contributions of this paper are to (1) implement the vector-based spatial configuration using the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model; (2) illustrate how the spatial
configuration of the model affects simulations of basin-average quantities
(i.e., streamflow) as well as the spatial variability of internal processes
(snow water equivalent, SWE, and evapotranspiration, ET); and (3) describe the work and challenges ahead to improve the
spatial structure of land models. Our results show that a model
configuration with a lower number of computational units, once calibrated,
may have similar accuracy to model configurations with more computational
units. However, the different calibrated parameter sets produce a range of,
sometimes contradicting, internal states and fluxes. To better address the
shortcomings of the current generation of land models, we encourage the land
model community to adopt flexible spatial configurations to improve model
representations of fluxes and states at the scale of interest.

Monitoring of the seasonal variations and trends in ice thickness is also important for the operation of winter ice roads that northern communities rely on for the movement of goods as well as for cultural and leisure activities (e.g., snowmobiling). Therefore, consistent measurements of ice thickness over lakes is important; however, field measurements tend to be sparse in both space and time in many northern countries. Here, we present an application of L-band frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) for the estimation of lake ice thickness. The proof of concept is demonstrated through the analysis of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) time series extracted from Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation L1 band raw data acquired between 8 and 22 March (2017 and 2019) at 14 lake ice sites located in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Dominant frequencies are extracted using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE) for the retrieval of ice thickness. Estimates compare favorably with in-situ measurements (mean absolute error = 0.05 m, mean bias error = −0.01 m, and root mean square error = 0.07 m). These results point to the potential of GPS/GNSS-IR as a complementary tool to traditional field measurements for obtaining consistent ice thickness estimates at many lake locations, given the relatively low cost of GNSS antennas/receivers.</abstract><url hash="8d966359">2020.GWF-1.106</url><doi>10.3390/rs12172721</doi><bibkey>Ghiasi-etal-2020-Application</bibkey></paper><paper id="107"><title>Identifying groundwater discharge zones in the Central Mackenzie Valley using remotely sensed optical and thermal imagery</title><author><first>Brittney</first><last>K.

Given that this area is undergoing active shale oil exploration and climatic changes, identification of groundwater discharge zones is of great importance both for pinpointing potential contaminant transport pathways and for characterizing the hydrologic system. Following the work of Morse and Wolfe (2015), a series of image algorithms were applied to imagery for the entire CMV and for the Bogg Creek watershed (a sub watershed of the CMV) for selected years between 2004 and 2017. Icings were statistically examined for all of the selected years to determine whether a significant difference in their spatial occurrence existed. It was concluded that there was a significant difference in the spatial distribution of icings from year to year (α = 0.05), but that there were several places where icings were recurring. During the summer of 2018, these recurrent icings, which are expected to be spring sourced, were verified using a thermal camera aboard a helicopter, as well as in situ measurements of hydraulic gradient, groundwater geochemistry, and electroconductivity. Strong agreement was found between the mapped icings and summer field data, making them ideal field monitoring locations. Furthermore, identifying these discharge points remotely is expected to have drastically reduced the field efforts that would have been required to find them in situ. This work demonstrates the value of remote sensing methods for hydrogeological applications, particularly in remote northern locations.</abstract><url hash="fa9153cf">2020.GWF-1.107</url><doi>10.1139/cjes-2019-0169</doi><bibkey>K.

These fluctuating flows downstream can exert several potential stressors on organisms that may inhibit their growth, indirectly causing higher contaminant concentrations through reduced growth dilution. We collected spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) at two sites upstream and two sites downstream of a peaking hydroelectric dam in east‐central Saskatchewan, Canada, and compared their body condition, triglyceride concentrations, and mercury concentrations. Condition decline was observed in one of two downstream sites from August to September, and the lowest triglyceride concentrations were consistently found downstream of the dam where hydropeaking had the most perceptible effects on the shoreline. Mercury concentrations were significantly greater at both downstream sites relative to upstream. Despite these results, inconsistencies in response parameters across sites and time limited our ability to isolate the effects of hydropeaking as a causative agent and suggest indirect effects such as shifts in algal and macroinvertebrate communities may be responsible for our observations. These results suggest that hydroelectric power generation may indirectly increase mercury concentrations in downstream fish, but more research will be required to determine the specific mechanisms by which this occurs. The results and data also provide useful insights into the physiology of wild spottail shiner populations, which can help to inform the development of these fish as a North American sentinel species.</abstract><url hash="6a2e4e5e">2020.GWF-1.108</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3625</doi><bibkey>J.

This is particularly important in Canada with its tens of thousands of lakes. Past large-scale hydrologic modelling efforts tend to either ignore the impacts of all lakes or explicitly simulate the behaviour of only the largest lakes in a watershed. This research derives a suite of Pan-Canadian subwatershed-based lake and river routing GIS products at multiple spatial resolutions (average catchment size ranges from 60 to 306 km2 while the number of lakes explicitly represented ranges from 11,000 to 87,000). These publicly available data products supply all the necessary hydrologic routing model inputs, including network topology, subwatershed geometry, channel characteristics (slope, length, roughness, and geometry), and lake characteristics (area, volume, and outlet description), and were derived primarily from the HydroLAKES, HydroBASINS and HydroSHEDS databases. All Water Survey of Canada streamflow gauging stations are used to define subwatershed outlets in the products. The routing product is used to inform a hydrologic routing model in the Raven hydrologic modelling framework. This is the first demonstration of Raven in routing-only mode. As a case study, the Hudson Bay drainage basin (∼40% of Canada) is simulated using GEM-Surf land surface model gridded runoff and recharge as inputs and includes more than 20,000 river reaches and more than 10,000 lakes explicitly represented at an hourly timestep. Uncalibrated streamflows compare reasonably well to measured streamflows at select locations. The sensitivity of the routing model prediction quality to the discretization level for represented lakes is evaluated and shows, for example, that ignoring multiple smaller lakes can have a significant impact on predictions.</abstract><url hash="1d297ec8">2020.GWF-1.109</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2020.1772116</doi><bibkey>Han-etal-2020-Subwatershed-based</bibkey></paper><paper id="110"><title>Among-site variability in environmental and management characteristics: Effect on nutrient loss in agricultural tile drainage</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Hanrahan</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>King</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Williams</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Stinner</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7deef72d">2020.GWF-1.110</url><doi>10.1016/j.jglr.2020.02.004</doi><bibkey>Hanrahan-etal-2020-Among-site</bibkey></paper><paper id="111"><title>Seeing beneath disputes: A transdisciplinary framework for diagnosing complex conservation conflicts</title><author><first>Hannah</first><last>L.

Such systems transform a user's gaze input into mouse pointer coordinates that can trigger keystrokes on an on-screen keyboard. However, typing using this approach requires large back-and-forth eye movements, and the required effort depends both on the length of the text and the keyboard layout. Motivated by the idea of sketch-based image search, we explore a gaze-based approach where users draw a shape on a sketchpad using gaze input, and the shape is used to search for similar letters, words, and other predefined controls. The sketch-based approach is area efficient (compared to an on-screen keyboard), allows users to create custom commands, and creates opportunities for gaze-based authentication. Since variation in the drawn shapes makes the search difficult, the system can show a guide (e.g., a 14-segment digital display) on the sketchpad so that users can trace their desired shape. In this paper, we take a first step that investigates the feasibility of the sketch-based approach, by examining how well users can trace a given shape using gaze input. We designed an interface where participants traced a set of given shapes. We then compared the similarity of the drawn and traced shapes. Our study results show the potential of the sketch-based approach: users were able to trace shapes reasonably well using gaze input, even for complex shapes involving three letters; shape tracing accuracy for gaze was better than `free-form' hand drawing. We also report on how different shape complexities influence the time and accuracy of the shape tracing tasks.</abstract><url hash="93e09601">2020.GWF-1.112</url><doi>10.1145/3396339.3396390</doi><bibkey>Rakib Hasan-etal-2020-Tracing</bibkey></paper><paper id="113"><title>Increasing contribution of peatlands to boreal evapotranspiration in a warming climate</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Alekseychik</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Amiro</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Aurela</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Barr</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>A.

Monitoring lake ice cover is also required to enable more reliable weather forecasting across lake-rich northern latitudes. Currently, the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) monitors lakes using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery through visual interpretation, with total lake ice cover reported weekly as a fraction out of ten. An automated method of classification would allow for more detailed records to be delivered operationally. In this research, we present an automatic ice-mapping approach which integrates unsupervised segmentation from the Iterative Region Growing using Semantics (IRGS) algorithm with supervised random forest (RF) labeling. IRGS first locally segments homogeneous regions in an image, then merges similar regions into classes across the entire scene. Recently, these output regions were manually labeled by the user to generate ice maps, or were labeled using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Here, three labeling methods (Manual, SVM, and RF) are applied after IRGS segmentation to perform ice-water classification on 36 RADARSAT-2 scenes of Great Bear Lake (Canada). SVM and RF classifiers are also tested without integration with IRGS. An accuracy assessment has been performed on the results, comparing outcomes with author-generated reference data, as well as the reported ice fraction from CIS. The IRGS-RF average classification accuracy for this dataset is 95.8%, demonstrating the potential of this automated method to provide detailed and reliable lake ice cover information operationally.</abstract><url hash="7a833334">2020.GWF-1.114</url><doi>10.3390/rs12091425</doi><bibkey>Hoekstra-etal-2020-Lake</bibkey></paper><paper id="115"><title>Impact of wildfire on permafrost landscapes: A review of recent advances and future prospects</title><author><first>Jean</first><last>E.

Here we review recent publications (2010–2019) that advance our understanding of the effects of wildfire on surface and ground temperatures, on active layer thickness and, where permafrost is ice‐rich, on ground subsidence and the development of thermokarst features. These thermal and geomorphic changes are initiated immediately following wildfire and alter the hydrology and biogeochemistry of permafrost landscapes, including the release of previously frozen carbon. In many locations, permafrost has been resilient, with key characteristics such as active layer thickness returning to pre‐fire conditions after several decades. However, permafrost near its southern limit is losing this resiliency as a result of ongoing climate warming and increasingly common vegetation state changes. Shifts in fire return intervals, severity and extent are expected to alter the trajectories of wildfire impacts on permafrost, and to enlarge spatial impacts to more regularly include the burning of tundra areas. Modeling indicates some lowland boreal forest and tundra environments will remain resilient while uplands and areas with thin organic layers and dry soils will experience rapid and irreversible permafrost degradation. More work is needed to relate modeling to empirical studies, particularly incorporating dynamic variables such as soil moisture, snow and thermokarst development, and to identify post‐fire permafrost responses for different landscape types and regions. Future progress requires further collaboration among geocryologists, ecologists, hydrologists, biogeochemists, modelers and remote sensing specialists.</abstract><url hash="0d8403a2">2020.GWF-1.115</url><doi>10.1002/ppp.2048</doi><bibkey>E.

Schneider</last></author><abstract>Scientific workflow management systems such as Galaxy, Taverna and Workspace, have been developed to automate scientific workflow management and are increasingly being used to accelerate the specification, execution, visualization, and monitoring of data-intensive tasks. For example, the popular bioinformatics platform Galaxy is installed on over 168 servers around the world and the social networking space myExperiment shares almost 4,000 Galaxy scientific workflows among its 10,665 members. Most of these systems offer graphical interfaces for composing workflows. However, while graphical languages are considered easier to use, graphical workflow models are more difficult to comprehend and maintain as they become larger and more complex. Text-based languages are considered harder to use but have the potential to provide a clean and concise expression of workflow even for large and complex workflows. A recent study showed that some scientists prefer script/text-based environments to perform complex scientific analysis with workflows. Unfortunately, such environments are unable to meet the needs of scientists who prefer graphical workflows. In order to address the needs of both types of scientists and at the same time to have script-based workflow models because of their underlying benefits, we propose a visually guided workflow modeling framework that combines interactive graphical user interface elements in an integrated development environment with the power of a domain-specific language to compose independently developed and loosely coupled services into workflows. Our domain-specific language provides scientists with a clean, concise, and abstract view of workflow to better support workflow modeling. As a proof of concept, we developed VizSciFlow, a generalized scientific workflow management system that can be customized for use in a variety of scientific domains. As a first use case, we configured and customized VizSciFlow for the bioinformatics domain. We conducted three user studies to assess its usability, expressiveness, efficiency, and flexibility.

This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 ± 14 wt%), alternately supplied with oxygen‐rich brackish water from above and oxygen‐poor, low‐saline GW from below. The low‐saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (δ13CDOC − 26.9‰ to − 27.7‰), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate ( SO42− ) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42− ‐reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42− concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 μmol m−2 d−1 during a 14‐day, low‐saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions.

Water resources in cold regions in western Canada face severe risks
posed by anthropogenic global warming as evapotranspiration increases
and precipitation regimes shift. Although understanding the water
cycle is key for addressing climate change issues, it is difficult to
obtain high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations of
hydroclimatic processes, especially in remote regions. Climate models
are useful tools for dissecting and diagnosing these processes,
especially the convection-permitting (CP) high-resolution regional
climate simulation, which provides advantages over lower-resolution models by explicitly representing convection. In addition to better representing
convective systems, higher spatial resolution also better represents
topography, mountain meteorology, and highly heterogeneous
geophysical features. However, there is little work with
convection-permitting regional climate models conducted over western
Canada. Focusing on the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins, this
study investigated the surface water budget and atmospheric moisture
balance in historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) projections using 4 km CP Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF). We compared the high-resolution 4 km CP
WRF and three common reanalysis datasets, namely the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), and
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
reanalysis interim dataset (ERA-Interim). High-resolution WRF outperforms the reanalyses in
balancing the surface water budget in both river basins with much
lower residual terms. For the pseudo-global-warming scenario at the
end of the 21st century with representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) radiative forcing, both the
Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins show increases in the
amplitude for precipitation and evapotranspiration and a decrease in
runoff. The Saskatchewan River basin (SRB) shows a moderate increase in
precipitation in the west and a small decrease in the east. Combined
with a significant increase in evapotranspiration in a warmer climate,
the Saskatchewan River basin would have a larger deficit of water
resources than in the current climate based on the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulation. The
high-resolution simulation also shows that the difference of atmospheric
water vapour balance in the two river basins is due to flow
orientation and topography differences at the western boundaries of
the two basins. The sensitivity of water vapour balance to fine-scale
topography and atmospheric processes shown in this study demonstrates
that high-resolution dynamical downscaling is important for
large-scale water balance and hydrological cycles.</abstract><url hash="56c3a4ee">2020.GWF-1.120</url><doi>10.5194/hess-24-3677-2020</doi><bibkey>Kurkute-etal-2020-Assessment</bibkey></paper><paper id="121"><title>Integrated assessment of west coast of South Korea by use of benthic bacterial community structure as determined by eDNA, concentrations of contaminants, and in vitro bioassays.</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Lee</last></author><author><first>Junghyun</first><last>Lee</last></author><author><first>Seongjin</first><last>Hong</last></author><author><first>Bong-Oh</first><last>Kwon</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Giesy</last></author><author><first>Xiaowei</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Khim</last></author><abstract /><url hash="21c49478">2020.GWF-1.121</url><doi>10.1016/j.envint.2020.105569</doi><bibkey>Lee-etal-2020-Integrated</bibkey></paper><paper id="122"><title>Inactivation of bacterial planktonic cells and biofilms by Cu(II)-activated peroxymonosulfate in the presence of chloride ion</title><author><first>Hye-Jin</first><last>Lee</last></author><author><first>Hyung-Eun</first><last>Kim</last></author><author><first>Min</first><last>Sik Kim</last></author><author><first>Charles-François</first><last>de Lannoy</last></author><author><first>Changha</first><last>Lee</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b8cdc5c2">2020.GWF-1.122</url><doi>10.1016/J.CEJ.2019.122468</doi><bibkey>Lee-etal-2020-Inactivation</bibkey></paper><paper id="123"><title>SAGA: Efficient and Large-Scale Detection of Near-Miss Clones with GPU Acceleration</title><author><first>Guanhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Yijian</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Jun</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Xin</first><last>Peng</last></author><author><first>Nanjie</first><last>Zhan</last></author><author><first>Bin</first><last>Hu</last></author><author><first>Jingyi</first><last>Ma</last></author><abstract>Clone detection on large code repository is necessary for many big code analysis tasks. The goal is to provide rich information on identical and similar code across projects. Detecting near-miss code clones on big code is challenging since it requires intensive computing and memory resources as the scale of the source code increases. In this work, we propose SAGA, an efficient suffix-array based code clone detection tool designed with sophisticated GPU optimization. SAGA not only detects Type-l and Type-2 clones but also does so for cross-project large repositories and for the most computationally expensive Type-3 clones. Meanwhile, it also works at segment granularity, which is even more challenging. It detects code clones in 100 million lines of code within 11 minutes (with recall and precision comparable to state-of-the-art approaches), which is more than 10 times faster than state-of-the-art tools. It is the only tool that efficiently detects Type-3 near-miss clones at segment granularity in large code repository (e.g., within 11 hours on 1 billion lines of code). We conduct a preliminary case study on 85,202 GitHub Java projects with 1 billion lines of code and exhibit the distribution of clones across projects. We find about 1.23 million Type-3 clone groups, containing 28 million lines of code at arbitrary segment granularity, which are only detectable with SAGA. We believe SAGA is useful in many software engineering applications such as code provenance analysis, code completion, change impact analysis, and many more.</abstract><url hash="cfcaf554">2020.GWF-1.123</url><doi>10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054832</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2020-SAGA:</bibkey></paper><paper id="124"><title>Climate Changes and Their Teleconnections With ENSO Over the Last 55 Years, 1961–2015, in Floods‐Dominated Basin, Jiangxi Province, China</title><author><first>Hongyi</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyong</first><last>Zhong</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Ma</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Tang</last></author><author><first>Leiding</first><last>Ding</last></author><author><first>Xinxin</first><last>Sui</last></author><author><first>Jintao</first><last>Xu</last></author><author><first>Yu</first><last>He</last></author><abstract>The relative effect of climate change and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is essential not only for understanding the hydrological mechanism over Jiangxi province in China but also for local water resources management as well as flood control.

Rain gauges, weather radars, and satellites are three mainstream data sources used in measuring precipitation but have their own inherent advantages and deficiencies. With a focus on extremes, the overarching goal of this study is to cross-examine the similarities and differences of three state-of-the-art independent products (Muti-Radar Muti-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimates, MRMS; National Center for Environmental Prediction gridded gauge-only hourly precipitation product, NCEP; Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM, IMERG), with both traditional metrics and the Multiplicative Triple Collection (MTC) method during Hurricane Harvey and multiple Tropical Cyclones. The results reveal that: (a) the consistency of cross-examination results against traditional metrics approves the applicability of MTC in extreme events; (b) the consistency of cross-events of MTC evaluation results also suggests its robustness across individual storms; (c) all products demonstrate their capacity of capturing the spatial and temporal variability of the storm structures while also magnifying respective inherent deficiencies; (d) NCEP and IMERG likely underestimate while MRMS overestimates the storm total accumulation, especially for the 500-year return Hurricane Harvey; (e) both NCEP and IMERG underestimate extreme rainrates (&gt;= 90 mm/h) likely due to device insensitivity or saturation while MRMS maintains robust across the rainrate range; (g) all three show inherent deficiencies in capturing the storm core of Harvey possibly due to device malfunctions with the NCEP gauges, relative low spatiotemporal resolution of IMERG, and the unusual “hot” MRMS radar signals. Given the unknown ground reference assumption of MTC, this study suggests that MRMS has the best overall performance. The similarities, differences, advantages, and deficiencies revealed in this study could guide the users for emergency response and motivate the community not only to improve the respective sensor/algorithm but also innovate multidata merging methods for one best possible product, specifically suitable for extreme storm events.</abstract><url hash="26a95061">2020.GWF-1.125</url><doi>10.3390/rs12081258</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2020-Cross-Examination</bibkey></paper><paper id="126"><title>Modeling the Fate of Pharmaceuticals in a Fourth‐Order River Under Competing Assumptions of Transient Storage</title><author><first>Y.</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Zarfl</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Basu</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Cirpka</last></author><abstract>Quantifying the degradation of micropollutants in streams is important for river‐water quality management. While biodegradation is believed to be enhanced in transient‐storage zones of rivers, it can also occur in the main channel. Photodegradation is restricted to the main channel and surface transient‐storage zones. In this study, we propose a transient‐storage model framework to address the transport and fate of micropollutants in different domains of a river. We fitted the model to nighttime and daytime measurements of a tracer and four pharmaceuticals in River Steinlach, Germany. We could separate the surface and subsurface fractions of the total transient‐storage zone by fitting fluorescein photodegradation at daytime versus conservative nighttime transport. In reactive transport, we tested two model variants, allowing biodegradation in the main channel or restricting it to the transient‐storage zones, obtaining similar model performances but different degradation rate coefficients. Carbamazepine is relatively conservative; photodegradation of metoprolol and venlafaxine can be quantitatively attributed to the main channel and surface transient‐storage zone; metoprolol, venlafaxine, and sulfamethoxazole undergo biodegradation. We projected a decrease of overall pollutant removal under higher flow conditions, regardless of attributing biodegradation to specific river compartments. Our study indicates that model‐based analysis of daytime and nighttime field experiments allows (1) distinguishing photodegradation and biodegradation, (2) reducing equifinality of surface and subsurface transient‐storage, and (3) estimating biodegradation in different domains under different assumptions. However, entirely reducing the equifinality of attributing biodegradation to different compartments is hardly possible in lowland rivers with only limited transient storage.</abstract><url hash="bfa001db">2020.GWF-1.126</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR026100</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2020-Modeling</bibkey></paper><paper id="127"><title>Intertemporal Substitution in Travel Cost Models with Seasonal Time Constraints</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Lloyd‐Smith</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Abbott</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Adamowicz</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Willard</last></author><abstract>Travel cost models using the wage rate to value time make the implicit assumption that the value of time is equalized throughout the year.

Therefore, calibration and downscaling are necessary before these products are applied. This study proposes a two-step framework to improve the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates. The first step is data merging based on optimum interpolation (OI), and the second step is downscaling based on geographically weighted regression (GWR); therefore, the framework is called OI-GWR. An Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) product is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of OI-GWR in the Tianshan Mountains, China. First, the original IMERG precipitation data (OIMERG) are merged with rain gauge data using the OI method to produce corrected IMERG precipitation data (CIMERG). Then, using CIMERG as the first guess and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the auxiliary variable, GWR is utilized for spatial downscaling. The two-step OI-GWR method is compared with several traditional methods, including GWR downscaling (Ori_GWR) and spline interpolation. The cross-validation results show that (1) the OI method noticeably improves the accuracy of OIMERG, and (2) the 1-km downscaled data obtained using OI-GWR are much better than those obtained from Ori_GWR, spline interpolation, and OIMERG. The proposed OI-GWR method can contribute to the development of high-resolution and high-accuracy regional precipitation datasets. However, it should be noted that the method proposed in this study cannot be applied in regions without any meteorological stations. In addition, further efforts will be needed to achieve daily- or hourly-scale downscaling of precipitation.</abstract><url hash="58182cdc">2020.GWF-1.128</url><doi>10.3390/rs12030398</doi><bibkey>Lu-etal-2020-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="129"><title>Assimilating snow observations to snow interception process simulations</title><author><first>Zhibang</first><last>Lv</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Snow interception is a crucial hydrological process in cold regions needleleaf forests, but is rarely measured directly. Indirect estimates of snow interception can be made by measuring the difference in the increase in snow accumulation between the forest floor and a nearby clearing over the course of a storm. Pairs of automatic weather stations with acoustic snow depth sensors provide an opportunity to estimate this, if snow density can be estimated reliably. Three approaches for estimating fresh snow density were investigated: weighted post‐storm density increments from the physically based Snobal model, fresh snow density estimated empirically from air temperature (Hedstrom, N. R., et al. [1998]. Hydrological Processes, 12, 1611–1625), and fresh snow density estimated empirically from air temperature and wind speed (Jordan, R. E., et al. [1999]. Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, 7785–7806). Automated snow depth observations from adjacent forest and clearing sites and estimated snow densities were used to determine snowstorm snow interception in a subalpine forest in the Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada. Then the estimated snow interception and measured interception information from a weighed, suspended tree and a time‐lapse camera were assimilated into a model, which was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM), using Ensemble Kalman Filter or a simple rule‐based direct insertion method. Interception determined using density estimates from the Hedstrom‐Pomeroy fresh snow density equation agreed best with observations. Assimilating snow interception information from automatic snow depth measurements improved modelled snow interception timing by 7% and magnitude by 13%, compared to an open loop simulation driven by a numerical weather model; its accuracy was close to that simulated using locally observed meteorological data. Assimilation of tree‐measured snow interception improved the snow interception simulation timing and magnitude by 18 and 19%, respectively. Time‐lapse camera snow interception information assimilation improved the snow interception simulation timing by 32% and magnitude by 7%. The benefits of assimilation were greatly influenced by assimilation frequency and quality of the forcing data.</abstract><url hash="2f1f1c4a">2020.GWF-1.129</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13720</doi><bibkey>Lv-etal-2020-Assimilating</bibkey></paper><paper id="130"><title>Reconstruction of past backyard skating seasons in the Original Six NHL cities from citizen science data</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Malik</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>McLeman</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Robertson</last></author><author><first>Haydn</first><last>Lawrence</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4fd895af">2020.GWF-1.130</url><doi>10.1111/cag.12640</doi><bibkey>Malik-etal-2020-Reconstruction</bibkey></paper><paper id="131"><title>Is the River a Chemostat?: Scale Versus Land Use Controls on Nitrate Concentration‐Discharge Dynamics in the Upper Mississippi River Basin</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Marinos</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>V.

Here, we show, using high‐resolution nitrate concentration data, that tile drainage is a dominant control on C‐Q dynamics, with increasing drainage density contributing to more chemostatic C‐Q behavior. We further find that concentration variability increases, relative to discharge variability, with increasing basin size across six orders of magnitude, and this pattern is attributed to different spatial correlation structures for C and Q. Our results show how land use and river network structure jointly control riverine N export.</abstract><url hash="38dfa539">2020.GWF-1.131</url><doi>10.1029/2020GL087051</doi><bibkey>Marinos-etal-2020-Is</bibkey></paper><paper id="132"><title>A Finite Volume Blowing Snow Model for Use With Variable Resolution Meshes</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Spiteri</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>Blowing snow is ubiquitous in cold, windswept environments. In some regions, blowing snow sublimation losses can ablate a notable fraction of the seasonal snowfall. It is advantageous to predict alpine snow regimes at the spatial scale of snowdrifts (≈1 to 100 m) because of the role of snow redistribution in governing the duration and volume of snowmelt. However, blowing snow processes are often neglected due to computational costs. Here, a three‐dimensional blowing snow model is presented that is spatially discretized using a variable resolution unstructured mesh. This represents the heterogeneity of the surface explicitly yet, for the case study reported, gained a 62% reduction in computational elements versus a fixed‐resolution mesh and resulted in a 44% reduction in total runtime. The model was evaluated for a subarctic mountain basin using transects of measured snow water equivalent (SWE) in a tundra valley. Including blowing snow processes improved the prediction of SWE by capturing inner‐annual snowdrift formation, more than halved the total mean bias error, and increased the coefficient of variation of SWE from 0.04 to 0.31 better matching the observed CV (0.41). The use of a variable resolution mesh did not dramatically degrade the model performance. Comparison with a constant resolution mesh showed a similar CV and RMSE as the variable resolution mesh.

Despite debate in the rainfall–runoff hydrology literature about the merits
of physics-based and spatially distributed models, substantial work in cold-region hydrology has shown improved predictive capacity by including
physics-based process representations, relatively high-resolution semi-distributed and
fully distributed discretizations, and the use of physically identifiable
parameters that require limited calibration. While there is increasing
motivation for modelling at hyper-resolution (  1 km) and snowdrift-resolving scales ( ≈  1 to 100 m), the capabilities of
existing cold-region hydrological models are computationally limited at
these scales. Here, a new distributed model, the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM), is
presented. Although designed to be applied generally, it has a focus for
application where cold-region processes play a role in hydrology. Key
features include the ability to do the following: capture spatial heterogeneity in the surface
discretization in an efficient manner via variable-resolution unstructured
meshes; include multiple process representations; change,
remove, and decouple hydrological process algorithms; work at both a
point and spatially distributed scale; scale to multiple spatial
extents and scales; and utilize a variety of forcing fields (boundary and
initial conditions). This paper focuses on the overall model philosophy
and design, and it provides a number of cold-region-specific features and
examples.</abstract><url hash="d6d1c415">2020.GWF-1.133</url><doi>10.5194/GMD-13-225-2020</doi><bibkey>Marsh-etal-2020-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="134"><title>Pore-scale controls on hydrological and geochemical processes in peat: Implications on interacting processes</title><author><first>C.</first><last>McCarter</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Rezanezhad</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Quinton</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Gharedaghloo</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Lennartz</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Price</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Connon</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Cappellen</last></author><abstract /><url hash="48b551b6">2020.GWF-1.134</url><doi>10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103227</doi><bibkey>McCarter-etal-2020-Pore-scale</bibkey></paper><paper id="135"><title>Mapping erosion and deposition in an agricultural landscape: Optimization of UAV image acquisition schemes for SfM-MVS</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Meinen</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Robinson</last></author><abstract /><url hash="3fb26120">2020.GWF-1.135</url><doi>10.1016/j.rse.2020.111666</doi><bibkey>Meinen-etal-2020-Mapping</bibkey></paper><paper id="136"><title>Near-0 °C surface temperature and precipitation type patterns across Canada</title><author><first>E.</first><last>Mekis</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Kochtubajda</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Bonsal</last></author><author><first>Zhuo</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The 0  ∘ C temperature threshold is critical for
many meteorological and hydrological processes driven by melting and
freezing in the atmosphere, surface, and sub-surface and by the associated
precipitation varying between rain, freezing rain, wet snow, and snow. This
threshold is especially important in cold regions such as Canada, because it
is linked with freeze–thaw, snowmelt, and permafrost. This study develops a
Canada-wide perspective on near-0  ∘ C conditions using hourly
surface temperature and precipitation type observations from 92 climate
stations for the period from 1981 to 2011. In addition, nine stations from
various climatic regions are selected for further analysis. Near-0  ∘ C conditions are defined as periods when the surface
temperature is between −2 and 2  ∘ C. Near-0  ∘ C conditions occur often across all regions of the country, although the
annual number of days and hours and the duration of these events varies
dramatically. Various types of precipitation (e.g., rain, freezing
rain, wet snow, and ice pellets) sometimes occur with these temperatures. Near-0  ∘ C conditions and the reported precipitation type
occurrences tend to be higher in Atlantic Canada, although high values also
occur in other regions. Trends of most temperature-based and
precipitation-based indicators show little or no change despite a systematic
warming in annual surface temperatures over Canada. Over the annual cycle,
near-0  ∘ C temperatures and precipitation often exhibit a pattern:
short durations occur around summer, driven by the diurnal cycle, and a tendency toward longer
durations around winter, associated with storms. There is
also a tendency for near-0  ∘ C surface temperatures to occur more
often than expected relative to other temperature windows at some stations
due, at least in part, to diabatic cooling and heating that take place with melting
and freezing, respectively, in the atmosphere and at the surface.</abstract><url hash="a6bb309a">2020.GWF-1.136</url><doi>10.5194/hess-24-1741-2020</doi><bibkey>Mekis-etal-2020-Near-0</bibkey></paper><paper id="137"><title>Associating Code Clones with Association Rules for Change Impact Analysis</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

These entities constitute the impact set for the target entity. Association rules have been widely used for discovering the impact sets. However, such rules only depend on the previous co-change history of the program entities ignoring the fact that similar entities might often need to be updated together consistently even if they did not co-change before. Considering this fact, we investigate whether cloning relationships among program entities can be associated with association rules to help us better identify the impact sets. In our research, we particularly investigate whether the impact set detection capability of a clone detector can be utilized to enhance the capability of the state-of-the-art association rule mining technique, Tarmaq, in discovering impact sets. We use the well known clone detector called NiCad in our investigation and consider both regular and micro-clones. Our evolutionary analysis on thousands of commit operations of eight diverse subject systems reveals that consideration of code clones can enhance the impact set detection accuracy of Tarmaq with a significantly higher precision and recall. Micro-clones of 3LOC and 4LOC and regular code clones of 5LOC to 20LOC contribute the most towards enhancing the detection accuracy.</abstract><url hash="d1bc000c">2020.GWF-1.137</url><doi>10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054846</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2020-Associating</bibkey></paper><paper id="138"><title>HistoRank: History-Based Ranking of Co-change Candidates</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

If two or more program entities co-change (i.e., change together) frequently during evolution, it is expected that the entities are coupled. This type of coupling is called evolutionary coupling or change coupling in the literature. Evolutionary coupling is realized using association rules and two measures: support and confidence. Association rules have been extensively used for predicting co-change candidates for a target program entity (i.e., an entity that a programmer attempts to change). However, association rules often predict a large number of co-change candidates with many false positives. Thus, it is important to rank the predicted co-change candidates so that the true positives get higher priorities. The predicted co-change candidates have always been ranked using the support and confidence measures of the association rules. In our research, we investigate five different ranking mechanisms on thousands of commits of ten diverse subject systems. On the basis of our findings, we propose a history-based ranking approach, HistoRank (History-based Ranking), that analyzes the previous ranking history to dynamically select the most appropriate one from those five ranking mechanisms for ranking co-change candidates of a target program entity. According to our experiment result, HistoRank outperforms each individual ranking mechanism with a significantly better MAP (mean average precision). We investigate different variants of HistoRank and realize that the variant that emphasizes the ranking in the most recent occurrence of co-change in the history performs the best.</abstract><url hash="41031d9d">2020.GWF-1.138</url><doi>10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054869</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2020-HistoRank:</bibkey></paper><paper id="139"><title>Investigating Near-Miss Micro-Clones in Evolving Software</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

While the existing studies have extensively studied regular code clones in software systems, micro-clones have been mostly ignored. Although an existing study investigated consistent changes in exact micro-clones, near-miss micro-clones have never been investigated. In our study, we investigate the importance of near-miss micro-clones in software evolution and maintenance by automatically detecting and analyzing the consistent updates that they experienced during the whole period of evolution of our subject systems. We compare the consistent co-change tendency of near-miss micro-clones with that of exact micro-clones and regular code clones. According to our investigation on thousands of revisions of six open-source subject systems written in two different programming languages, near-miss micro-clones have a significantly higher tendency of experiencing consistent updates compared to exact micro-clones and regular (both exact and near-miss) code clones. Consistent updates in near-miss micro-clones have a high tendency of being related with bug-fixes. Moreover, the percentage of commit operations where near-miss micro-clones experience consistent updates is considerably higher than that of regular clones and exact micro-clones. We finally observe that near-miss micro-clones staying in close proximity to each other have a high tendency of experiencing consistent updates. Our research implies that near-miss micro-clones should be considered equally important as of regular clones and exact micro-clones when making clone management decisions.</abstract><url hash="36042d0b">2020.GWF-1.139</url><doi>10.1145/3387904.3389262</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2020-Investigating</bibkey></paper><paper id="140"><title>A survey on clone refactoring and tracking</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Here, the activity of Fe2+ as cofactor for a few RNA‐cleaving DNAzymes is investigated. 17E is a well‐studied DNAzyme that is active in the presence of many different divalent metal ions; it is highly active with Fe2+ with an apparent Kd of 29.7±2.3 μm and a kobs of 1.12±0.11 min−1 in the presence of 1 mm Fe2+ at pH 7.5. Fe2+ has 21‐fold higher activity than Mg2+. Six different DNAzymes are then tested, and only the DNAzymes active with Mg2+ (17E, 8–17, and E5) are active with Fe2+. Fe2+ has 25 and one‐ to twofold higher activity than Mg2+ for the 8–17 and E5 DNAzymes, respectively. In pH&gt;7 buffer and in presence of air, 1 mm Fe2+ results in a nonspecific degradation of the DNA strand due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cleavage reactions in anoxic environment and antioxidant ascorbate can be used to overcome the effect of oxidation. The findings provide insights for potential DNAzyme catalysis in the early Earth, and they further support the similarity between Mg2+ and Fe2+ in enzyme catalysis.</abstract><url hash="779e33fe">2020.GWF-1.141</url><doi>10.1002/cbic.201900344</doi><bibkey>J.

While lake ice monitoring through government networks has decreased in the last three decades, the increased availability of remote sensing images can help to provide consistent spatial and temporal coverage for areas with annual ice cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are commonly used for lake ice monitoring, due to the acquisition of images in any condition (time of day or weather). Using Sentinel-1 A/B images, a high-density time series of SAR images was developed for Lake Hazen in Nunavut, Canada, from 2015–2018. These images were used to test two different methods of monitoring lake ice phenology: one method using the first difference between SAR images and another that applies the Otsu segmentation method. Ice phenology dates determined from the two methods were compared with visual interpretation of the Sentinel-1 images. Mean errors for the pixel comparison of the first difference method ranged 3–10 days for ice-on and ice-off, while average error values for the Otsu method ranged 2–10 days. Mean errors for comparisons of different sections of the lake ranged 0–15 days for the first difference method and 2–17 days for the Otsu method. This research demonstrates the value of temporally consistent image acquisition for improving the accuracy of lake ice monitoring.</abstract><url hash="999052d2">2020.GWF-1.143</url><doi>10.3390/rs12030382</doi><bibkey>Murfitt-etal-2020-Assessing</bibkey></paper><paper id="144"><title>Evaluating Performance of Clone Detection Tools in Detecting Cloned Cochange Candidates</title><author><first>Muhammad</first><last>Nadim</last></author><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>Code reuse by copying and pasting from one place to another place in a codebase is a very common scenario in software development which is also one of the most typical reasons for introducing code clones. There is a huge availability of tools to detect such cloned fragments and a lot of studies have already been done for efficient clone detection. There are also several studies for evaluating those tools considering their clone detection effectiveness. Unfortunately, we find no study which compares different clone detection tools in the perspective of detecting cloned co-change candidates during software evolution. Detecting cloned co-change candidates is essential for clone tracking. In this study, we wanted to explore this dimension of code clone research. We used six promising clone detection tools to identify cloned and non-cloned co-change candidates from six $C$ and Java-based subject systems and evaluated the performance of those clone detection tools in detecting the cloned co-change fragments. Our findings show that a good clone detector may not perform well in detecting cloned co-change candidates. The amount of unique lines covered by a clone detector and the number of detected clone fragments plays an important role in its performance. The findings of this study can enrich a new dimension of code clone research.</abstract><url hash="07f4c771">2020.GWF-1.144</url><doi>10.1109/IWSC50091.2020.9047639</doi><bibkey>Nadim-etal-2020-Evaluating</bibkey></paper><paper id="145"><title>A universal cross language software similarity detector for open source software categorization</title><author><first>Kawser</first><last>Wazed Nafi</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Northwestern Alaska has been highly affected by changing climatic patterns
with new temperature and precipitation maxima over the recent years. In
particular, the Baldwin and northern Seward peninsulas are characterized by
an abundance of thermokarst lakes that are highly dynamic and prone to lake
drainage like many other regions at the southern margins of continuous
permafrost. We used Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Planet
CubeSat optical remote sensing data to analyze recently observed widespread
lake drainage. We then used synoptic weather data, climate model outputs and
lake ice growth simulations to analyze potential drivers and future pathways
of lake drainage in this region. Following the warmest and wettest winter on
record in 2017/2018, 192 lakes were identified as having completely or
partially drained by early summer 2018, which exceeded the average drainage
rate by a factor of ∼ 10 and doubled the rates of the previous
extreme lake drainage years of 2005 and 2006. The combination of abundant
rain- and snowfall and extremely warm mean annual air temperatures (MAATs),
close to 0 ∘C, may have led to the destabilization of permafrost
around the lake margins. Rapid snow melt and high amounts of excess
meltwater further promoted rapid lateral breaching at lake shores and
consequently sudden drainage of some of the largest lakes of the study
region that have likely persisted for millennia. We hypothesize that permafrost
destabilization and lake drainage will accelerate and become the dominant
drivers of landscape change in this region. Recent MAATs are already within
the range of the predictions by the University of Alaska Fairbanks' Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (UAF SNAP) ensemble climate predictions in
scenario RCP6.0 for 2100. With MAAT in 2019 just below 0 ∘C at the nearby Kotzebue, Alaska, climate station, permafrost aggradation in drained lake basins will become less likely after drainage, strongly decreasing the potential for freeze-locking carbon sequestered in lake sediments, signifying a prominent regime shift in ice-rich permafrost lowland regions.

Results indicate that anthropogenic greenhouse gas influence is robustly detected in the observed intensification of extreme precipitation over the global land and most of the subregions considered, all with clear separation from natural and anthropogenic aerosol forcings. Also, the human‐induced greenhouse gas increases are found to be a dominant contributor to the observed increase in extreme precipitation intensity, which largely follows the increased moisture availability under global warming.</abstract><url hash="7945bbcc">2020.GWF-1.149</url><doi>10.1029/2019GL086875</doi><bibkey>Paik-etal-2020-Determining</bibkey></paper><paper id="150"><title>Random Fields Simplified: Preserving Marginal Distributions, Correlations, and Intermittency, With Applications From Rainfall to Humidity</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Serinaldi</last></author><abstract>Nature manifests itself in space and time. The spatiotemporal complexity of processes such as precipitation, temperature, and wind, does not allow purely deterministic modeling. Spatiotemporal random fields have a long history in modeling such processes, and yet a single unified framework offering the flexibility to simulate processes that may differ profoundly does not exist. Here we introduce a blueprint to efficiently simulate spatiotemporal random fields that preserve any marginal distribution, any valid spatiotemporal correlation structure, and intermittency. We suggest a set of parsimonious yet flexible marginal distributions and provide a rule of thumb for their selection. We propose a new and unified approach to construct flexible spatiotemporal correlation structures by combining copulas and survival functions. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated by simulating conceptual cases of intermittent precipitation, double‐bounded relative humidity, and temperature maxima fields. As a real‐word case we simulate daily precipitation fields. In all cases, we reproduce the desired properties. In an era characterized by advances in remote sensing and increasing availability of spatiotemporal data, we deem that this unified approach offers a valuable and easy‐to‐apply tool for modeling complex spatiotemporal processes.</abstract><url hash="19823229">2020.GWF-1.150</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR026331</doi><bibkey>Papalexiou-etal-2020-Random</bibkey></paper><paper id="151"><title>Process‐based assessment of success and failure in a constructed riffle‐pool river restoration project</title><author><first>E.</first><last>Papangelakis</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>MacVicar</last></author><abstract>Although there is increasing consensus that river restoration should focus on restoring processes rather than form, proven techniques to design and monitor projects for sediment transport processes are lacking. This study monitors bedload transport and channel morphology in a rural, an urban unrestored, and an urban restored reach. Objectives are to compare bedload transport regimes, assess the stability and self‐maintenance of constructed riffle‐pool sequences, and evaluate the impact of the project on coarse sediment continuity in the creek. Sediment tracking is done using radio frequency identification tracers and morphologic change is assessed from repeated cross‐section surveys. Mean annual velocity is used to quantify the average downstream velocity of tracers, defined as the mean overall tracer travel length divided by the total study duration. The channel reconstruction slows down the downstream velocity of particles in the D75 and D90 size classes, but does not significantly change the velocity of particles in the D50 size class or smaller. Surveys show that riffle features remain stable and that pool depths are maintained or deepened, while tracer paths match with what has been observed in natural riffle‐pools. However, the slowdown of coarse sediment and increase in channel slope may lead to future failures related to over‐steepening of the banks and a disruption in the continuity of sediment transport in the creek. This study demonstrates how bedload tracking and morphological surveys can be used to assess river restoration projects, and highlights the importance of incorporating coarse sediment connectivity into restoration design and monitoring.</abstract><url hash="6e8502bf">2020.GWF-1.151</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3636</doi><bibkey>Papangelakis-etal-2020-Process‐based</bibkey></paper><paper id="152"><title>In Situ Estimates of Freezing/Melting Point Depression in Agricultural Soils Using Permittivity and Temperature Measurements</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Pardo Lara</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>A.

In cold regions soil freeze‐thaw processes play a critical role in the surface energy and water balance, with implications ranging from agricultural yields to natural disasters. Although monitoring of the soil moisture phase state is of critical importance, there is an inability to interpret soil moisture instrumentation in frozen conditions. To address this gap, we investigated the freeze‐thaw response of a widely used soil moisture probe, the HydraProbe, in the laboratory. Soil freezing curves (SFCs) and soil thawing curves (STCs) were identified using the relationship between soil permittivity and temperature. The permittivity SFC/STC was fit using a logistic growth model to estimate the freezing/melting point depression (Tf/m) and its spread (s). Laboratory results showed that the fitting routine requires permittivity changes greater than 3.8 to provide robust estimates and suggested that a temperature bias is inherent in horizontally placed HydraProbes. We tested the method using field measurements collected over the last 7 years from the Environment and Climate Change Canada and the University of Guelph's Kenaston Soil Moisture Network in Saskatchewan, Canada. By dividing the time series into freeze‐thaw events and then into individual transitions, the permittivity SFC/STC was identified. The freezing and melting point depression for the network was estimated as Tf/m = − 0.35 ± 0.2,with Tf = − 0.41 ± 0.22 °C and Tm = − 0.29 ± 0.16 °C, respectively.</abstract><url hash="f78c5305">2020.GWF-1.152</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR026020</doi><bibkey>Pardo Lara-etal-2020-In</bibkey></paper><paper id="153"><title>Spatial and stratigraphic variation of near‐surface ground ice in discontinuous permafrost of the taiga shield</title><author><first>Jason</first><last>R.

The effect of thaw is largely determined by ground ice content in near‐surface permafrost, making the characterization and prediction of ground ice content critical. Here we evaluate the spatial and stratigraphic variation of near‐surface ground ice characteristics in the dominant forest types in the North Slave region near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. Physical variation in the permafrost was assessed through cryostructure, soil properties, and volumetric ice content, and relationships between these parameters were determined. Near‐surface ground ice characteristics were contrasted between forest types. In black spruce forests the top of the permafrost was ice‐rich and characterized by lenticular and ataxitic cryostructures, indicating the presence of an intermediate layer. Most white spruce/birch forests showed similar patterns; however, an increase in the active layer thickness and permafrost thaw at some sites have eradicated the transition zone, and the large ice lenses encountered at depth reflect segregated ground ice developed during initial downward aggradation of permafrost. Our findings indicate that white spruce/birch terrain will be less sensitive than black spruce forests to near‐surface permafrost thaw. However, if permafrost thaws completely, white spruce/birch terrain will probably be transformed into wetland–thaw lake complexes due to high ground ice content at depth.</abstract><url hash="808b6393">2020.GWF-1.153</url><doi>10.1002/ppp.2085</doi><bibkey>R.

The objective of this project was to refine and implement an FFQ to estimate the consumption of traditional locally harvested foods for Dene/Métis in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The strategy consisted of: 1) refining the FFQ through three focus groups and, 2) implementing the FFQ in Indigenous communities. Participants were asked to complete the FFQ using an iPad to document the types of traditional foods consumed over the past 12 months, as well as the consumption frequency, the portion size, and the preparation methods. Focus groups supported the refinement of the FFQ on the format, the list of foods, and the preparation methods listed in the questionnaire. The refined FFQ was then implemented with participants (n = 237). Findings indicated that the traditional foods most frequently consumed were moose, whitefish and lake trout. Participants who consumed fish and land animals reported, on average, a portion size for one serving of between 126 and 143 g, depending on age and sex. These findings increase knowledge of the current traditional food consumption of Dene/Métis communities and will support the assessment of contaminant exposure.</abstract><url hash="69e8c6a6">2020.GWF-1.155</url><doi>10.1080/22423982.2020.1760071</doi><bibkey>Ratelle-etal-2020-Food</bibkey></paper><paper id="156"><title>Anthropocene flooding: Challenges for science and society</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Gober</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Maier</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>Global Institute for Water Security, School of Environment and Sustainability, Department of Civil, Geological, and Environmental Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia Water Institute and Department of Economics, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada Institute for Environmental Studies, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK</abstract><url hash="f0e1971c">2020.GWF-1.156</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13723</doi><bibkey>Razavi-etal-2020-Anthropocene</bibkey></paper><paper id="157"><title>Multi-year isoscapes of lake water balances across a dynamic northern freshwater delta</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Remmer</last></author><author><first>Laura</first><last>K Neary</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Kay</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hall</last></author><abstract>Sustainable approaches capable of tracking status, trends and drivers of lake water balances in complex, remote landscapes are needed to inform ecosystem stewardship and water-security actions. At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (Alberta, Canada), a globally recognized freshwater floodplain landscape, concerns about water-level drawdown and multiple potential stressors have prompted need to improve knowledge of lake water balances and establish a lake monitoring program. Yet, the delta’s remoteness and dynamic nature present challenges to these goals. Here we use over 1000 measurements of water isotope composition at ∼60 lakes and 9 river sites during the spring, summer and fall of five consecutive years (2015–2019) to elucidate patterns in lake water balance over time and space, the influential roles of evaporation and river floodwaters, and relations with meteorological conditions and river water levels. Calculation of evaporation-to-inflow ratios using a coupled-isotope tracer approach, displayed via generalized additive models and geospatial ‘isoscapes’, reveal strongly varying lake water balances. Results identify distinct areas vulnerable to lake-level drawdown, given the likelihood of continued decline in ice-jam flood frequency, longer ice-free season duration and reduced snowmelt runoff. Results also demarcate areas of the delta where lakes are more resilient to factors that cause drawdown. The former defines the Peace sector, which is influenced by floodwaters from the Peace River during episodic ice-jam flood events, whereas the latter describes portions of the active floodplain environment of the Athabasca sector which receives more frequent contributions of Athabasca River floodwaters during both spring ice-jam and open-water seasons. Efficiency of water isotope tracers to capture the marked temporal and spatial heterogeneity in lake water balances during this 5 year time span, and their diagnostic responses to key hydrological processes, serves as a foundation for ongoing lake monitoring, an approach readily transferable to other remote and dynamic lake-rich landscapes.</abstract><url hash="87e6a78a">2020.GWF-1.157</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/abb267</doi><bibkey>Remmer-etal-2020-Multi-year</bibkey></paper><paper id="158"><title>Editorial: Wetland Biogeochemistry: Response to Environmental Change</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Rezanezhad</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>McCarter</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Lennartz</last></author><abstract /><url hash="1759ba1b">2020.GWF-1.158</url><doi>10.3389/fenvs.2020.00055</doi><bibkey>Rezanezhad-etal-2020-Editorial:</bibkey></paper><paper id="159"><title>An integrated environmental analytics system (IDEAS) based on a DGGS</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Robertson</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Chaudhuri</last></author><author><first>Majid</first><last>Hojati</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Roberts</last></author><abstract /><url hash="605e8a8d">2020.GWF-1.159</url><doi>10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.02.009</doi><bibkey>Robertson-etal-2020-An</bibkey></paper><paper id="160"><title>Wildfire impacts on hydrologic ecosystem services in North American high-latitude forests: A scoping review</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Robinne</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Hallema</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Bladon</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Buttle</last></author><abstract /><url hash="32af61ea">2020.GWF-1.160</url><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124360</doi><bibkey>Robinne-etal-2020-Wildfire</bibkey></paper><paper id="161"><title>A physically-based modelling framework for operational forecasting of river ice breakup</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Morales-Marín</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="45a8517c">2020.GWF-1.161</url><doi>10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103554</doi><bibkey>Rokaya-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="162"><title>Impacts of future climate on the hydrology of a northern headwaters basin and its implications for a downstream deltaic ecosystem</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Peters</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Budhathoki</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>Anthropogenic and climatic‐induced changes to flow regimes pose significant risks to river systems. Northern rivers and their deltas are particularly vulnerable due to the disproportionate warming of the Northern Hemisphere compared with the Southern Hemisphere. Of special interest is the Peace–Athabasca Delta (PAD) in western Canada, a productive deltaic lake and wetland ecosystem, which has been recognized as a Ramsar site. Both climate‐ and regulation‐induced changes to the hydrological regime of the Peace River have raised concerns over the delta's ecological health. With the damming of the headwaters, the role of downstream unregulated tributaries has become more important in maintaining, to a certain degree, a natural flow regime, particularly during open‐water conditions. However, their flow contributions to the mainstem river under future climatic conditions remain largely uncertain. In this study, we first evaluated the ability of a land‐surface hydrological model to simulate hydro‐ecological relevant indicators, highlighting the model's strengths and weaknesses. Then, we investigated the streamflow conditions in the Smoky River, the largest unregulated tributary of the Peace River, in the 2071–2100 versus the 1981–2010 periods. Our modelling results revealed significant changes in the hydrological regime of the Smoky River, such as increased discharge in winter (+190%) and spring (+130%) but reduced summer flows (−33%) in the 2071–2100 period compared with the baseline period, which will have implications for the sustainability of the downstream PAD. In particular, the projected reductions in 30‐day and 90‐day maximum flows in the Smoky River will affect open‐water flooding, which is important in maintaining lake levels and connectivity to perimeter delta wetlands in the Peace sector of the PAD. The evaluation of breakup and freeze‐up flows for the 2071–2100 period showed mixed implications for the ice‐jam flooding, which is essential for recharging high‐elevation deltaic basins. Thus, despite projected increase in annual and spring runoff in the 2071–2100 period from the Smoky sub‐basin, the sustainability of the PAD still remains uncertain.</abstract><url hash="dca100c6">2020.GWF-1.162</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13687</doi><bibkey>Rokaya-etal-2020-Impacts</bibkey></paper><paper id="163"><title>L-Band response to freeze/thaw in a boreal forest stand from ground- and tower-based radiometer observations</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Toose</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Mavrovic</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Pappas</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Royer</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Derksen</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Rowlandson</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>El-Amine</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Barr</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Black</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Langlois</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><abstract /><url hash="aba63050">2020.GWF-1.163</url><doi>10.1016/j.rse.2019.111542</doi><bibkey>Roy-etal-2020-L-Band</bibkey></paper><paper id="164"><title>A global near-real-time soil moisture index monitor for food security using integrated SMOS and SMAP</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Sadri</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Pan</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Wada</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Vergopolan</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Sheffield</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Kerr</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Wood</last></author><abstract /><url hash="35c2a5f3">2020.GWF-1.164</url><doi>10.1016/j.rse.2020.111864</doi><bibkey>Sadri-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="165"><title>Exploring Type Inference Techniques of Dynamically Typed Languages</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Saifullah</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Asaduzzaman</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>Developers often prefer dynamically typed programming languages, such as JavaScript, because such languages do not require explicit type declarations. However, such a feature hinders software engineering tasks, such as code completion, type related bug fixes and so on. Deep learning-based techniques are proposed in the literature to infer the types of code elements in JavaScript snippets. These techniques are computationally expensive. While several type inference techniques have been developed to detect types in code snippets written in statically typed languages, it is not clear how effective those techniques are for inferring types in dynamically typed languages, such as JavaScript. In this paper, we investigate the type inference techniques of JavaScript to understand the above two issues further. While doing that we propose a new technique that considers the locally specific code tokens as the context to infer the types of code elements. The evaluation result shows that the proposed technique is 20-47% more accurate than the statically typed language-based techniques and 5–14 times faster than the deep learning techniques without sacrificing accuracy. Our analysis of sensitivity, overlapping of predicted types and the number of training examples justify the importance of our technique.</abstract><url hash="42c59565">2020.GWF-1.165</url><doi>10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054814</doi><bibkey>Saifullah-etal-2020-Exploring</bibkey></paper><paper id="166"><title>Processes governing snow ablation in alpine terrain – detailed measurements from the Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Schirmer</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt are
important for estimating areal melt rates and snow-cover depletion (SCD) dynamics
but are rarely measured in detail during the late ablation period. This
study contributes results from high-resolution observations made using large numbers of sequential aerial photographs taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle on an alpine ridge in the Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory in the Canadian Rocky Mountains from May to July in 2015. Using structure-from-motion and thresholding techniques, spatial maps of snow depth, snow cover and differences in snow depth (dHS) during ablation were generated in very high resolution as proxies for spatial SWE, spatial ablation rates and SCD. The results indicate that the initial distribution of snow depth was highly variable due to overwinter snow redistribution; thus, the subsequent distribution of dHS was also variable due to albedo, slope/aspect and other unaccountable differences. However, the initial distribution of snow depth was 5 times more variable than that of the subsequent dHS values, which varied by a factor of 2 between the north and south aspects. dHS patterns were somewhat spatially persistent over time but had an insubstantial impact on SCD curves, which were overwhelmingly governed by the initial distribution of snow depth. The reason for this is that only a weak spatial correlation developed between the initial snow depth and dHS. Previous research has shown that spatial correlations between SWE and ablation rates can strongly influence SCD curves. Reasons for the lack of a correlation in this study area were analysed and a generalisation to other regions was discussed. The following questions were posed: what is needed for a large spatial correlation between initial snow depth and dHS? When should snow depth and dHS be taken into account to correctly model SCD? The findings of this study suggest that hydrological and atmospheric models need to incorporate realistic distributions of SWE, melt energy and cold content; therefore, they must account for realistic correlations (i.e. not too large or too small) between SWE and melt in order to accurately model SCD.</abstract><url hash="dbccc4df">2020.GWF-1.166</url><doi>10.5194/hess-24-143-2020</doi><bibkey>Schirmer-etal-2020-Processes</bibkey></paper><paper id="167"><title>New Insights into the Toxicokinetics of 3,4-Dichloroaniline in Early Life Stages of Zebrafish (Danio rerio)</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Schiwy</last></author><author><first>Ann-Kathrin</first><last>Herber</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Hollert</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Brinkmann</last></author><abstract>In the fish embryo toxicity (FET) test with zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is often employed as a positive control substance. Previous studies have characterized bioconcentration and transformation of 3,4-DCA in this test under flow-through conditions. However, the dynamic changes of chemical concentrations in exposure media and embryos were not studied systematically under the commonly used semi-static exposure conditions in multiwell plates. To overcome these limitations, we conducted semi-static exposures experiments where embryolarval zebrafish were exposed to 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mg L−1 of 3,4-DCA for up to 120 hpf, with 24-h renewal intervals. During each renewal interval, concentrations of 3,4-DCA were quantified in water samples at 0, 6, 18, and 24 h using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Levels of 3,4-DCA in larvae were measured after 120 h exposure. Concentrations of 3,4-DCA in the test vessels decreased rapidly during exposure. Taking these dynamics into account, bioconcentration factors in the present study ranged from 12.9 to 29.8 L kg−1, depending on exposure concentration. In summary, this study contributed to our knowledge of chemical dynamics in the FET test with embryolarval zebrafish, which will aid in defining suitable exposure conditions for future studies.</abstract><url hash="accbf449">2020.GWF-1.167</url><doi>10.3390/toxics8010016</doi><bibkey>Schiwy-etal-2020-New</bibkey></paper><paper id="168"><title>Retrieval of ice/water observations from synthetic aperture radar imagery for use in lake ice data assimilation</title><author><first>K.</first><last>A.

This study quantifies the contribution of ARs to annual, seasonal, and extreme precipitation across BCSAK from 1979 to 2012 using a recently developed high‐resolution gridded precipitation data set, a regional AR catalog, and integrated vapor transport fields calculated from a reanalysis data set. On average, ARs contribute 13% of total annual precipitation with the higher contribution along the coastal regions (up to 33%), parts of which are one of the wettest locations on Earth, followed by the Columbia and Rocky Mountains (~9%–15%). The highest contributions occur during September (up to 57%) and October (up to 49%). The contribution of ARs to extreme precipitation attains &gt;90% along the western arc of the Coast Mountains and the coastal regions of BCSAK. ARs act as the main synoptic‐scale mechanism that brings rainfall to the Rocky Mountains in winter. The probability of observing AR‐related precipitation increases over the study period; however, no change occurs in the average AR‐related precipitation amount for most of BCSAK during 1979–2012. This work provides insights on the critical role ARs play on the water resources of northwestern North America and has broader implications on community water supply and management, hydropower operations, and flood risk assessment and mitigation.</abstract><url hash="4b73d94e">2020.GWF-1.169</url><doi>10.1029/2019JD031823</doi><bibkey>Sharma-etal-2020-Contribution</bibkey></paper><paper id="170"><title>Linking Atmospheric Rivers to Annual and Extreme River Runoff in British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska</title><author><first>Aseem</first><last>R.

Datasets used include gauged runoff from 168 unregulated watersheds, topographic characteristics of those watersheds, a regional AR catalog, and integrated vapor transport fields for water years (WYs) 1979–2016. ARs contribute ~22% of annual river runoff along the Coast and Insular Mountains watersheds, which decreases inland to ~11% in the watersheds of the Interior Mountains and Plateau. Average association between ARs and annual maximum river runoff attains &gt;80%, &gt;50%, and &lt;50% along the watersheds of the western flanks of the Coast Mountains, the Interior Mountains, and Interior Plateau, respectively. There is no significant change in AR-related extreme annual maximum runoff across BCSAK during 1979–2016. AR conditions occur during 25 out of 32 of the flood-related natural disasters in British Columbia during WYs 1979–2016. AR-related annual maximum runoff magnitude is significantly higher than non-AR-related annual maximum runoff for 30% of the watersheds studied. Smaller and steeper watersheds closer to the coast are more susceptible to AR-related annual maximum runoff than their inland counterparts. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity as a major control for the distribution of peak runoff in BCSAK. This work provides insights on the hydrological response of watersheds of northwestern North America to landfalling ARs that may improve flood risk assessment and disaster management in this region.</abstract><url hash="2bb450ab">2020.GWF-1.170</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-19-0281.1</doi><bibkey>R.

These regions include the 625 million ha North American boreal region, which contains 16% of the world’s forests and plays a major role in the global carbon cycle (Brandt et al. 2013). Boreal ecosystems are particularly susceptible to rapid climatedriven vegetation change initiated by standreplacing natural disturbances (notably fires), which have increased in number, extent, and frequency (Kasischke and Turetsky 2006; Hanes et al. 2018) and are expected to continue under future climate change (Boulanger et al. 2014). Such disturbances will increasingly complicate species persistence, and it will therefore be critical to identify locations of possible climatechange refugia (areas “relatively buffered from contemporary climate change”) (Morelli et al. 2016). These “slow lanes” for biodiversity will be especially important for conservation and management of boreal species and ecosystems (Morelli et al. 2020). Practically speaking, the refugia concept can translate into specific sites or regions that are expected to be more resistant to the influence of climate change than other areas (“in situ refugia”; Ashcroft 2010). Refugia may also encompass sites or regions to which species may more readily retreat as climate conditions change (“ex situ refugia”; Ashcroft 2010; Keppel et al. 2012), as well as temporary “stepping stones” (Hannah et al. 2014) linking current and future habitats. In addition to areas that are climatically buffered, fire refugia – “places that are disturbed less frequently or less severely by wildfire” (Krawchuk et al. 2016) – may also play key roles in promoting ecosystem persistence under changing conditions (Meddens et al. 2018). Previous examinations of climatechange refugia have primarily emphasized external, terrainmediated mechanisms.

Such “trend scaling” rates are difficult to estimate from observations, however, because of limited data availability and high background variability. Intra-annual temperature scaling (here called binning scaling), which relates extreme precipitation to temperature at or near the time of occurrence, has been suggested as a possible substitute for trend scaling. We use a large ensemble simulation of the Canadian regional climate model (CanRCM4) to assess this possibility, considering both daily near-surface air temperature and daily dewpoint temperature as scaling variables. We find that binning curves that are based on precipitation data for the whole year generally look like the composite of binning curves for winter and summer, with the lower temperature portion similar to winter and the higher temperature portion similar to summer, indicating that binning curves reflect seasonal changes in the relationship between temperature and extreme precipitation. The magnitude and spatial pattern of binning and trend scaling rates are also quantitatively different, with little spatial correlation between them, regardless of precipitation duration or choice of temperature variable. The evidence therefore suggests that binning scaling with temperature is not a reliable predictor for future changes in precipitation extremes in the climate simulated by CanRCM4. Nevertheless, external forcing does have a discernable influence on binning curves, which are seen to shift upward and to the right in some regions, consistent with a general increase in extreme precipitation.</abstract><url hash="b2bd0111">2020.GWF-1.173</url><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-19-0920.1</doi><bibkey>Sun-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="174"><title>Have satellite precipitation products improved over last two decades?

An important function of the boreal forest is its ability to sequester and store carbon (C). Increasing disturbance from wildfires, emitting large amounts of C to the atmosphere, may create a positive feedback to climate warming. Variation in ecosystem structure and function throughout the boreal forest is important for predicting the effects of climate warming and changing fire regimes on C dynamics. In this study, we compiled data on soil characteristics, stand structure, pre-fire C pools, C loss from fire, and the potential drivers of these C metrics from 527 sites distributed across six ecoregions of North America’s western boreal forests. We assessed structural and functional differences between these fire-prone ecoregions using data from 417 recently burned sites (2004–2015) and estimated ecoregion-specific relationships between soil characteristics and depth from 167 of these sites plus an additional 110 sites (27 burned, 83 unburned). We found that northern boreal ecoregions were generally older, stored and emitted proportionally more belowground than aboveground C, and exhibited lower rates of C accumulation over time than southern ecoregions. We present ecoregion-specific estimates of depth-wise soil characteristics that are important for predicting C combustion from fire. As climate continues to warm and disturbance from wildfires increases, the C dynamics of these fire-prone ecoregions are likely to change with significant implications for the global C cycle and its feedbacks to climate change.</abstract><url hash="b5d0c508">2020.GWF-1.177</url><doi>10.3389/ffgc.2020.00087</doi><bibkey>Walker-etal-2020-Patterns</bibkey></paper><paper id="178"><title>Synergistically Boosted Degradation of Organic Dyes by CeO2 Nanoparticles with Fluoride at Low pH</title><author><first>Yawen</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Tongtong</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>Catalysts that can work without the need of light and additional oxidants such as H2O2 to degrade organic pollutants have been long sought.

We report on physical model experiments designed to compare alluvial cover dynamics in straight and sinuous fixed‐bed channels at a range of gravel‐bed material supply rates and constant discharge conditions. Experiments investigated the formation of alluvial cover from a bare bed, relationships between equilibrium cover characteristics and sediment supply rate, and the evolution of an initial uniform cover of varying thickness. A stable partially‐alluviated state is achieved in both the straight and sinuous channels for a range of sediment supply rates. The areal extent and stored mass of the cover increase progressively with supply rate, and the rate of increase is higher in the straight channel. While alluvial cover develops from isolated patches in the straight channel, cover in the sinuous channel develops as well‐defined bars, with deposition on the inside of bends and expanding outwards along the channel as cover area increases. Artificially emplaced cover quickly adjusts to a cover extent within 4–20% of that formed from a bare bed at the same feed rate, with initial cover thickness only influencing the final cover in the sinuous channel. Neither the sinuous nor the straight channel can sustain an alluvial cover in the absence of upstream sediment supply. This study can inform the management of semi‐alluvial channels because it highlights the primary roles of sediment supply and planform geometry in maintaining an alluvial cover in natural and engineered channels.</abstract><url hash="5268e80f">2020.GWF-1.179</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3699</doi><bibkey>Welber-etal-2020-Experiments</bibkey></paper><paper id="180"><title>Changes to rainfall, snowfall, and runoff events during the autumn–winter transition in the Rocky Mountains of North America</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Shook</last></author><abstract>Abstract In cold conditions, early winter precipitation occurs as snowfall and contributes to the accumulating seasonal snowpack. In a warming climate, precipitation may occur as rainfall in mountainous areas. Detecting changes during seasonal transitions is difficult because these may encompass changes in timing, magnitude and phase, which may not be consistent between years. In this study, a sampling window from September to December is used to assess trends in magnitude, frequency and duration (of rainfall, snowfall and runoff events) in 127 climate stations and 128 watersheds with more than 30 years of record across the Rocky Mountains of North America. Rainfall events have increasing frequencies and durations, and magnitude trends are predominantly increasing at mid-latitude and mid-elevation. Snowfall events have the largest numbers of significant trends, with both increasing and decreasing trends in each of magnitude, frequency and duration. Snowfall events have decreasing frequencies and durations in the northern low-elevation sites and increasing frequencies and durations at the southern high-elevation sites. Trends in runoff events are less common than for rainfall and snowfall but are greater than expected by chance, and show similar frequency and duration patterns to snowfall trends. Snowfall and runoff events are decreasing in frequency and duration north of Wyoming and increasing to the south. Snowfall magnitude is generally decreasing to the north and increasing to the south, with runoff magnitude trends showing the reverse.</abstract><url hash="ac2c4c64">2020.GWF-1.180</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2019.1685910</doi><bibkey>Whitfield-etal-2020-Changes</bibkey></paper><paper id="181"><title>Spatial patterns of temporal changes in Canadian Prairie streamflow using an alternative trend assessment approach</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Shook</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="db2b7cf2">2020.GWF-1.181</url><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124541</doi><bibkey>Whitfield-etal-2020-Spatial</bibkey></paper><paper id="182"><title>On the sensitivity of modelled groundwater recharge estimates to rain gauge network scale</title><author><first>Andrew</first><last>J.

Whilst most peat resistance to wildfire and drought research is based on deep peatlands that rarely lose their water table below the peat profile, shallow peatlands and peat deposits may be most vulnerable to high peat burn severity and extensive carbon loss. To examine the role of pre-fire peat depth on peat burn severity, we measured the depth of burn (DOB) in peat of varying depths (0.1–1.6 m) within a rock barrens landscape. We found that DOB (0–0.4 m) decreased with increasing pre-fire peat depth, and that there was a strong correlation between the percent of the profile that burned and pre-fire peat depth. Breakpoint analysis indicates a threshold depth of 0.66 m where deeper peat deposits experienced little impact of wildfire, whereas shallower peat typically experienced high peat burn severity (median percent burned = 2.2 and 65.1, respectively). This threshold also corresponded to the loss of the water table in some nearby unburned peatlands, where water table drawdown rates were greater in shallower peat. We suggest that peat depth may control peat burn severity through feedbacks that regulate water table drawdown. As such, we argue that the identification of a critical peat depth threshold could have important implications for wildfire management and peatland restoration aiming to protect vulnerable carbon stores.</abstract><url hash="35251dde">2020.GWF-1.183</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e8</doi><bibkey>Wilkinson-etal-2020-Shallow</bibkey></paper><paper id="184"><title>Past variation in Lower Peace River ice-jam flood frequency</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hall</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Wiklund</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Kay</last></author><abstract>Opposing interpretations of Lower Peace River ice-jam flood frequency data sets are at the centre of identifying causes of reduced freshwater availability in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (northern Alb...</abstract><url hash="ab41887d">2020.GWF-1.184</url><doi>10.1139/er-2019-0047</doi><bibkey>Wolfe-etal-2020-Past</bibkey></paper><paper id="185"><title>Divergent effects of climate change on future groundwater availability in key mid-latitude aquifers</title><author><first>Wen‐Ying</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Lo</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Wada</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Reager</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Yeh</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Ducharne</last></author><author><first>Zong‐Liang</first><last>Yang</last></author><abstract /><url hash="dc46b8eb">2020.GWF-1.185</url><doi>10.1038/s41467-020-17581-y</doi><bibkey>Wu-etal-2020-Divergent</bibkey></paper><paper id="186"><title>Hydrophobicity of peat soils: Characterization of organic compound changes associated with heat-induced water repellency.</title><author><first>Yichen</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Slater</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><author><first>Charles-François</first><last>de Lannoy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="454fe951">2020.GWF-1.186</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136444</doi><bibkey>Wu-etal-2020-Hydrophobicity</bibkey></paper><paper id="187"><title>Influence of wastewater microbial community on the performance of miniaturized microbial fuel cell biosensor.</title><author><first>Nan</first><last>Xiao</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><author><first>Rong</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Huang</last></author><abstract /><url hash="3248d9c7">2020.GWF-1.187</url><doi>10.1016/j.biortech.2020.122777</doi><bibkey>Xiao-etal-2020-Influence</bibkey></paper><paper id="188"><title>Anode surface modification regulates biofilm community population and the performance of micro-MFC based biochemical oxygen demand sensor</title><author><first>Nan</first><last>Xiao</last></author><author><first>Rong</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a2f7c456">2020.GWF-1.188</url><doi>10.1016/j.ces.2020.115691</doi><bibkey>Xiao-etal-2020-Anode</bibkey></paper><paper id="189"><title>Detection of fouling on electrically conductive membranes by electrical impedance spectroscopy</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Halali</last></author><author><first>Charles-François</first><last>de Lannoy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d5f0f4c0">2020.GWF-1.189</url><doi>10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116823</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2020-Detection</bibkey></paper><paper id="190"><title>Adjustments for Wind-Induced Undercatch in Snowfall Measurements Based on Precipitation Intensity</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Colli</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Stagnaro</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Lanza</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><abstract>Adjustments for the wind-induced undercatch of snowfall measurements use transfer functions to account for the expected reduction of the collection efficiency with increasing the wind speed for a particular catching-type gauge. Based on field experiments or numerical simulation, collection efficiency curves as a function of wind speed also involve further explanatory variables such as surface air temperature and/or precipitation type. However, while the wind speed or wind speed and temperature approach is generally effective at reducing the measurement bias, it does not significantly reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the residuals, implying that part of the variance is still unexplained. In this study, we show that using precipitation intensity as the explanatory variable significantly reduces the scatter of the residuals. This is achieved by optimized curve fitting of field measurements from the Marshall Field Site (Colorado, United States), using a nongradient optimization algorithm to ensure optimal binning of experimental data. The analysis of a recent quality-controlled dataset from the Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE) campaign of the World Meteorological Organization confirms the scatter reduction, showing that this approach is suitable to a variety of locations and catching-type gauges. Using computational fluid dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the physical basis of the reduction in RMSE is the correlation of precipitation intensity with the particle size distribution. Overall, these findings could be relevant in operational conditions since the proposed adjustment of precipitation measurements only requires wind sensor and precipitation gauge data.</abstract><url hash="b5377d25">2020.GWF-1.190</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-19-0222.1</doi><bibkey>Colli-etal-2020-Adjustments</bibkey></paper><paper id="191"><title>Accounting for Adaptive Water Supply Management When Quantifying Climate and Land Cover Change Vulnerability</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Gorelick</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Lin</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Zeff</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Kim</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Vose</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Coulston</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Wear</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Band</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Reed</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Characklis</last></author><abstract>Climate and land cover change strongly shape water resources management, but understanding their joint impacts is extremely challenging. Consequently, there is limited research of their integrated effects on water supply systems, and even fewer studies that rigorously account for infrastructure investment and management interventions. We utilize ecohydrologic modeling to generate watershed outflows under scenarios of climate and land cover change, which in turn drive modeled water utility‐level decision making for the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. In the Triangle region, land cover and climate change are both likely to increase water supply availability (reservoir inflows) individually and in tandem. However, improvements from water supply increases are not uniform across management system performance indicators of reliability, conservation implementation frequency (i.e., water use restrictions), and infrastructure investment. Utility decisions influence the impact of hydrologic change through both short‐term (e.g., use restrictions and water transfers) and longer‐term infrastructure investment actions, in some cases offsetting the beneficial effects of additional water supply. Timing and sequencing of infrastructure development are strongly sensitive to climate and land use change as captured by their impacts on utility performance outcomes. This work underscores the need to consider adaptive management system responses and decision‐relevant performance measures when determining the impacts of hydrologic change on water availability.</abstract><url hash="c2304db3">2020.GWF-1.191</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR025614</doi><bibkey>Gorelick-etal-2020-Accounting</bibkey></paper><paper id="192"><title>A guide to shortening the time from submission to publication in Frontiers of Environmental Science &amp; Engineering</title><author><first>Jiao</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Xia</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Hao</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Crittenden</last></author><abstract /><url hash="5b391c09">2020.GWF-1.192</url><doi>10.1007/s11783-020-1231-3</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2020-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="193"><title>Scientists’ warning to humanity on the freshwater biodiversity crisis</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Albert</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Destouni</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Duke-Sylvester</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Magurran</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Oberdorff</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Reis</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Winemiller</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Ripple</last></author><abstract /><url hash="2c3e2c9f">2020.GWF-1.193</url><doi>10.1007/s13280-020-01318-8</doi><bibkey>Albert-etal-2020-Scientists’</bibkey></paper><paper id="194"><title>Transforming Cities and Science for Climate Change Resilience in the Anthropocene</title><author><first>T.</first><last>McPhearson</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b25ab93c">2020.GWF-1.194</url><doi>10.1007/978-3-030-49040-9_3</doi><bibkey>McPhearson-etal-2020-Transforming</bibkey></paper><paper id="195"><title>Extreme precipitation events in the Mediterranean: Spatiotemporal characteristics and connection to large‐scale atmospheric flow patterns</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Mastrantonas</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Herrera‐Lormendez</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Magnusson</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Pappenberger</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Matschullat</last></author><abstract>The Mediterranean region is strongly affected by extreme precipitation events (EPEs), sometimes leading to severe negative impacts on society, economy, and the environment. Understanding such natural hazards and their drivers is essential to mitigate related risks. Here, EPEs over the Mediterranean between 1979 and 2019 are analysed, using ERA5, the latest reanalysis dataset from ECMWF. EPEs are determined based on the 99th percentile of their daily distribution (P99). The different EPE characteristics are assessed, based on seasonality and spatiotemporal dependencies. To better understand their connection to large‐scale atmospheric flow patterns, Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis and subsequent non‐hierarchical K‐means clustering are used to quantify the importance of weather regimes to EPE frequency. The analysis is performed for different variables, depicting atmospheric variability in the lower and middle troposphere. Results show a clear spatial division in EPE occurrence, with winter and autumn being the seasons of highest EPE frequency for the eastern and western Mediterranean, respectively. There is a high degree of temporal dependencies with 20% of the EPEs (median value based on all studied grid cells), occurring up to 1 week after a preceding P99 event at the same location. Local orography is a key modulator of the spatiotemporal connections and substantially enhances the probability of co‐occurrence of EPEs even for distant locations. The clustering clearly demonstrates the prevalence of distinct synoptic‐scale atmospheric conditions during the occurrence of EPEs for different locations within the region. Results indicate that clustering, based on a combination of sea level pressure (SLP) and geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500), can increase the conditional probability of EPEs by more than three (3) times (median value for all grid cells) from the nominal probability of 1% for the P99 EPEs. Such strong spatiotemporal dependencies and connections to large‐scale patterns can support extended‐range forecasts.</abstract><url hash="c55d89aa">2020.GWF-1.195</url><doi>10.1002/joc.6985</doi><bibkey>Mastrantonas-etal-2020-Extreme</bibkey></paper><paper id="196"><title>Multiscale global sensitivity analysis for stochastic chemical systems</title><author><first>Michael</first><last>Merritt</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Alexanderian</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Gremaud</last></author><abstract>Sensitivity analysis is routinely performed on simplified surrogate models as the cost of such analysis on the original model may be prohibitive.

 &lt;p&gt;Irrigation practices introduce imbalances in the natural hydrological cycle at different spatial scales and put pressure on water resources, especially under climate changing and population increasing scenarios. Despite the implications of irrigation on food production and on the rational management of the available freshwater, detailed information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs is still lacking. For this reason, the comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of the hydrological cycle over agricultural areas is often tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first aim of this study is to evaluate the capability of five remote sensing soil moisture data sets to detect the irrigation signal over an intensely irrigated area located within the Ebro river basin, in the North of Spain, during the biennium 2016-2017. As a second objective, a methodology to map the irrigated areas through the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The remotely sensed soil moisture products used in this study are: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) at 1 km, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) at 1 km and 9 km, Sentinel-1 at 1 km and ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) at 12.5 km. The 1 km versions of SMOS and SMAP are DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled versions of the corresponding coarser resolution products. An additional data set of soil moisture simulated by the SURFEX-ISBA (&lt;em&gt;Surface Externalis&amp;#233;e - Interaction Sol Biosph&amp;#232;re Atmosph&amp;#232;re&lt;/em&gt;) land surface model is used as a support for the performed analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capability of soil moisture products to detect irrigation has been investigated by exploiting indices representing the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture. The L-band passive microwave downscaled products, especially SMAP at 1 km, result the best performing ones in detecting the irrigation signal over the pilot area; on the basis of these data sets, the K-means algorithm has been employed to classify three kinds of surfaces within the study area: the dryland, the forest or natural areas, and the actually irrigated areas. The resulting maps have been validated by exploiting maps of crops in Catalonia as ground truth data set. The percentage of irrigated areas well classified by the proposed method reaches the value of 78%; this result is obtained for the period May - September 2017. In addition, the method performs well in distinguishing the irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural areas, which are dry during summer, thus representing a useful tool to obtain explicit spatial information about where irrigation practices actually occur over agricultural areas equipped for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
