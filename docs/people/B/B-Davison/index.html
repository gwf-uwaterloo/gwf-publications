The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades.Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate–land–hydrologicalsystems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrologicalmodels. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and basepredictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions ofnon-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the futureand system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefrontin the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), whichassembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise toimprove the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation andexperimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins andother sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality andprocess representation, based on this improved understanding, within thefine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and thelarge-scale Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) – Surfaceand Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, appliedunder past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historicalchange and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second oftwo articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to theatmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.84.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Limited studies have been performed on constraining the model parameters, despite the fact that the presence of a large number of parameters may provide large degree of freedom, resulting in equifinality and poor model performance. In this study, a multi-objective optimization approach is adopted, and both streamflow and soil moisture data are calibrated simultaneously for an experimental study basin in the Saskatchewan Prairies in western Canada. The results of this study show that the multi-objective calibration improves model fidelity compared to the single objective calibration. Moreover, the study demonstrates that single objective calibration performed against only streamflow can fairly mimic the streamflow hydrograph but does not yield realistic estimation of other fluxes such as evapotranspiration and soil moisture (especially in deeper soil layers).</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.222.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Reservoirs significantly affect flow regimes in watershed systems by changing the magnitude and timing of streamflows. Failure to represent these effects limits the performance of hydrological and land-surface models (H-LSMs) in the many highly regulated basins across the globeand limits the applicability of such models to investigate the futures ofwatershed systems through scenario analysis (e.g., scenarios of climate,land use, or reservoir regulation changes). An adequate representation ofreservoirs and their operation in an H-LSM is therefore essential for arealistic representation of the downstream flow regime. In this paper, wepresent a general parametric reservoir operation model based on piecewise-linear relationships between reservoir storage, inflow, and release toapproximate actual reservoir operations. For the identification of the modelparameters, we propose two strategies: (a) a “generalized”parameterization that requires a relatively limited amount of data and(b) direct calibration via multi-objective optimization when more data onhistorical storage and release are available. We use data from 37 reservoircase studies located in several regions across the globe for developing andtesting the model. We further build this reservoir operation model into theMESH (Modélisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie) modeling system, which is a large-scale H-LSM. Our results across thecase studies show that the proposed reservoir model with bothparameter-identification strategies leads to improved simulation accuracycompared with the other widely used approaches for reservoir operationsimulation. We further show the significance of enabling MESH with thisreservoir model and discuss the interdependent effects of the simulationaccuracy of natural processes and that of reservoir operations on the overallmodel performance. The reservoir operation model is generic and can beintegrated into any H-LSM.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.48.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, complex models, for example, the so‐called physically based models, possess large degrees of freedom that, if not constrained properly, may lead to poor model performance when used for prediction. We argue that constraining a model to represent streamflow, which is an integrated resultant of many factors across the watershed, is necessary but by no means sufficient to develop a high‐fidelity model. To address this problem, we develop a framework to utilize the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment's (GRACE) total water storage anomaly data as a supplement to streamflows for model calibration, in a multiobjective setting. The VARS method (Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces) for global sensitivity analysis is used to understand the model behaviour with respect to streamflow and GRACE data, and the BORG multiobjective optimization method is applied for model calibration. Two subbasins of the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada are used as a case study. Results show that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration only to streamflows, even when multiple streamflow‐based error functions are simultaneously minimized. It is shown that a range of (possibly false) system trajectories in state variable space can lead to similar (acceptable) model responses. This observation has significant implications for land‐surface and hydrologic model development and, if not addressed properly, may undermine the credibility of the model in prediction. The framework effectively constrains the model behaviour (by constraining posterior parameter space) and results in more credible representation of hydrology across the watershed.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=B.+Davison" title="Search for 'B.
