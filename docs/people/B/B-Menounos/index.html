Direct measurements of this relation using remotely-sensed methods are complicated by ice dynamics, so observations are currently limited to glaciers where surface mass-balance measurements are routinely made. We test the viability of using the continuity equation to estimate annual surface mass balance between flux-gates in the absence of in situ measurements, on five glaciers in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Repeat airborne laser scanning surveys of glacier surface elevation, ice penetrating radar surveys and publicly available maps of ice thickness are used to estimate changes in surface elevation and ice flux. We evaluate this approach by comparing modeled to observed mass balance. Modeled mass-balance gradients well-approximate those obtained from direct measurement of surface mass balance, with a mean difference of +6.6 ± 4%. Regressing modeled mass balance, equilibrium line altitudes are on average 15 m higher than satellite-observations of the transient snow line. Estimates of mass balance over flux bins compare less favorably than the gradients. Average mean error (+0.03 ± 0.07 m w.e.) between observed and modeled mass balance over flux bins is relatively small, yet mean absolute error (0.55 ± 0.18 m w.e.) and average modeled mass-balance uncertainty (0.57 m w.e.) are large. Mass conservation, assessed with glaciological data, is respected (when estimates are within 1σ uncertainties) for 84% of flux bins representing 86% of total glacier area. Uncertainty on ice velocity, especially for areas where surface velocity is low (&lt;10 m a−1) contributes the greatest error in estimating ice flux. We find that using modeled ice thicknesses yields comparable modeled mass-balance gradients relative to using observations of ice thickness, but we caution against over-interpreting individual flux-bin mass balances due to large mass-balance residuals. Given the performance of modeled ice thickness and the increasing availability of ice velocity and surface topography data, we suggest that similar efforts to produce mass-balance gradients using modern high-resolution datasets are feasible on larger scales.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.37.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This paper presents hydrometeorological, glaciologicaland geospatial data from the Peyto Glacier Research Basin (PGRB) in theCanadian Rockies. Peyto Glacier has been of interest to glaciological andhydrological researchers since the 1960s, when it was chosen as one of fiveglacier basins in Canada for the study of mass and water balance during theInternational Hydrological Decade (IHD, 1965–1974). Intensive studies of theglacier and observations of the glacier mass balance continued after theIHD, when the initial seasonal meteorological stations were discontinued,then restarted as continuous stations in the late 1980s. The correspondinghydrometric observations were discontinued in 1977 and restarted in 2013.Datasets presented in this paper include high-resolution, co-registereddigital elevation models (DEMs) derived from original air photos and lidar surveys; hourly off-glaciermeteorological data recorded from 1987 to the present; precipitation data fromthe nearby Bow Summit weather station; and long-term hydrological and glaciological modelforcing datasets derived from bias-corrected reanalysis products. These dataare crucial for studying climate change and variability in the basin andunderstanding the hydrological responses of the basin to both glacier andclimate change. The comprehensive dataset for the PGRB is a valuable andexceptionally long-standing testament to the impacts of climate change onthe cryosphere in the high-mountain environment. The dataset is publiclyavailable from Federated Research Data Repository athttps://doi.org/10.20383/101.0259 (Pradhananga etal., 2020).</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.44.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The interaction of mountain terrain with meteorological processes causes substantial temporal and spatial variability in snow accumulation and ablation. Processes impacted by complex terrain include large-scale orographic enhancement of snowfall, small-scale processes such as gravitational and wind-induced transport of snow, and variability in the radiative balance such as through terrain shadowing. In this study, a multi-scale modelling approach is proposed to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of high-mountain snowpacks. The multi-scale approach combines atmospheric data from a numerical weather prediction system at the kilometre scale with process-based downscaling techniques to drive the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) at spatial resolutions allowing for explicit snow redistribution modelling. CHM permits a variable spatial resolution by using the efficient terrain representation by unstructured triangular meshes. The model simulates processes such as radiation shadowing and irradiance to slopes, blowing-snow transport (saltation and suspension) and sublimation, avalanching, forest canopy interception and sublimation, and snowpack melt. Short-term, kilometre-scale atmospheric forecasts from Environment and Climate Change Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale Model through its High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) drive CHM and are downscaled to the unstructured mesh scale. In particular, a new wind-downscaling strategy uses pre-computed wind fields from a mass-conserving wind model at 50 m resolution to perturb the mesoscale HRDPS wind and to account for the influence of topographic features on wind direction and speed. HRDPS-CHM was applied to simulate snow conditions down to 50 m resolution during winter 2017/2018 in a domain around the Kananaskis Valley (∼1000 km2) in the Canadian Rockies. Simulations were evaluated using high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) snow depth data and snow persistence indexes derived from remotely sensed imagery. Results included model falsifications and showed that both wind-induced and gravitational snow redistribution need to be simulated to capture the snowpack variability and the evolution of snow depth and persistence with elevation across the region. Accumulation of windblown snow on leeward slopes and associated snow cover persistence were underestimated in a CHM simulation driven by wind fields that did not capture lee-side flow recirculation and associated wind speed decreases. A terrain-based metric helped to identify these lee-side areas and improved the wind field and the associated snow redistribution. An overestimation of snow redistribution from windward to leeward slopes and subsequent avalanching was still found. The results of this study highlight the need for further improvements of snowdrift-permitting models for large-scale applications, in particular the representation of subgrid topographic effects on snow transport.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.61.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Crevasses have the potential to bias geodetic measurements of elevation and mass change unless they are properly accounted for. We developed a framework that automatically maps and extracts crevasse geometry and masks them where they interfere with surface mass-balance assessment. Our study examines airborne light detection and ranging digital elevation models (LiDAR DEMs) from Haig Glacier, which is experiencing a transient response in its crevassed upper regions as the glacier thins, using a self-organizing map algorithm. This method successfully extracts and characterizes ~1000 crevasses, with an overall accuracy of 94%. The resulting map provides insight into stress and flow conditions. The crevasse mask also enables refined geodetic estimates of summer mass balance. From differencing of September and April LiDAR DEMs, the raw LiDAR DEM gives a 9% overestimate in the magnitude of glacier thinning over the summer: −5.48 m compared with a mean elevation change of −5.02 m when crevasses are masked out. Without identification and removal of crevasses, the LiDAR-derived summer mass balance therefore has a negative bias relative to the glaciological surface mass balance.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.129.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

No comprehensive analysis of recent mass change exists for this region. We generated over 15,000 multisensor digital elevation models from spaceborne optical imagery to provide an assessment of mass change for WNA over the period 2000–2018. These glaciers lost 117 ± 42 gigatons (Gt) of mass, which accounts for up to 0.32 ± 0.11 mm of sea level rise over the full period of study. We observe a fourfold increase in mass loss rates between 2000–2009 [−2.9 ± 3.1 Gt yr−1] and 2009–2018 [−12.3 ± 4.6 Gt yr−1], and we attribute this change to a shift in regional meteorological conditions driven by the location and strength of upper level zonal wind.

Seasonal measurements of glacier mass balance provideinsight into the relation between climate forcing and glacier change. Toevaluate the feasibility of using remotely sensed methods to assess seasonalbalance, we completed tandem airborne laser scanning (ALS) surveys andfield-based glaciological measurements over a 4-year period for sixalpine glaciers that lie in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains, near theheadwaters of the Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada. We calculatedannual geodetic balance using coregistered late summer digital elevationmodels (DEMs) and distributed estimates of density based on surfaceclassification of ice, snow, and firn surfaces. Winter balance was derivedusing coregistered late summer and spring DEMs, as well as density measurementsfrom regional snow survey observations and our glaciological measurements.Geodetic summer balance was calculated as the difference between winter andannual balance. Winter mass balance from our glaciological observationsaveraged 1.95±0.09 m w.e. (meter water equivalent), 4 % larger than those derived fromgeodetic surveys. Average glaciological summer and annual balance were 3 %smaller and 3 % larger, respectively, than our geodetic estimates. We findthat distributing snow, firn, and ice density based on surface classificationhas a greater influence on geodetic annual mass change than the densityvalues themselves. Our results demonstrate that accurate assessments ofseasonal mass change can be produced using ALS over a series of glaciersspanning several mountain ranges. Such agreement over multiple seasons,years, and glaciers demonstrates the ability of high-resolution geodeticmethods to increase the number of glaciers where seasonal mass balance canbe reliably estimated.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=B.+Menounos" title="Search for 'B.
