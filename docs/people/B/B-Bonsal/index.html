The 0  ∘ C temperature threshold is critical formany meteorological and hydrological processes driven by melting andfreezing in the atmosphere, surface, and sub-surface and by the associatedprecipitation varying between rain, freezing rain, wet snow, and snow. Thisthreshold is especially important in cold regions such as Canada, because itis linked with freeze–thaw, snowmelt, and permafrost. This study develops aCanada-wide perspective on near-0  ∘ C conditions using hourlysurface temperature and precipitation type observations from 92 climatestations for the period from 1981 to 2011. In addition, nine stations fromvarious climatic regions are selected for further analysis. Near-0  ∘ C conditions are defined as periods when the surfacetemperature is between −2 and 2  ∘ C. Near-0  ∘ C conditions occur often across all regions of the country, although theannual number of days and hours and the duration of these events variesdramatically. Various types of precipitation (e.g., rain, freezingrain, wet snow, and ice pellets) sometimes occur with these temperatures. Near-0  ∘ C conditions and the reported precipitation typeoccurrences tend to be higher in Atlantic Canada, although high values alsooccur in other regions. Trends of most temperature-based andprecipitation-based indicators show little or no change despite a systematicwarming in annual surface temperatures over Canada. Over the annual cycle,near-0  ∘ C temperatures and precipitation often exhibit a pattern:short durations occur around summer, driven by the diurnal cycle, and a tendency toward longerdurations around winter, associated with storms. There isalso a tendency for near-0  ∘ C surface temperatures to occur moreoften than expected relative to other temperature windows at some stationsdue, at least in part, to diabatic cooling and heating that take place with meltingand freezing, respectively, in the atmosphere and at the surface.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.90.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This study assesses surface and atmospheric conditions associated with the 2014 extreme wildfires in the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada. Hot and dry conditions led to the NWT experiencing the most severe wildfire season in its recorded history. The season included a record number of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes and set a record for area burned. Lightning was the dominant ignition source and accounted for about 95% of the wildfires. Prolonged periods of smoke led to dramatic reductions in visibility, frequent road closures, and reduced air quality resulting in numerous health alerts. Temporal and spatial patterns of lightning characteristics in 2014, derived from Canadian Lightning Detection Network data, were different from those in other years with, for example, far more positive flashes from 0600 to 1200 utc (midnight to 6:00 am local time). The highest fraction of positive cloud-to-ground flashes (43.1%) occurred in the smoke-dominated North Slave region, which was more than in the Dehcho, South Slave, or Sahtu regions. Mid-tropospheric atmospheric circulation over a large region that included the NWT was classified into the six most common summer patterns. Results showed that ridging and ridge displacements occurred more frequently during 2014 although lightning was associated with all circulation patterns. This study has advanced the understanding of the roles of weather, lightning, and mid-tropospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme wildfires in northwestern Canada.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.171.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This paper studies the implications of hydro-climatic trends on river ice processes, particularly on the freeze-up and ice-cover breakup along the Athabasca River in Fort McMurray in western Canada, which is an area very prone to ice-jam flooding. Using a stochastic approach in a one-dimensional hydrodynamic river ice model, a relationship between overbank flow and breakup discharge is established. Furthermore, the likelihood of ice-jam flooding in the future (2041–2070 period) is assessed by forcing a hydrological model with meteorological inputs from the Canadian regional climate model driven by two atmospheric–ocean general circulation climate models. Our results show that the probability of ice-jam flooding for the town of Fort McMurray in the future will be lower, but extreme ice-jam flood events are still probable.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.172.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Previous studies have shown that both climate and regulation affect IJF probabilities, but their relative impacts are poorly understood. This study presents a probabilistic modelling framework that couples hydrologic and hydraulic models to assess the relative role of regulated and naturalized flows on ice‐affected backwater staging. The framework is evaluated at an IJF‐prone town on the Peace River in western Canada, which has been regulated since 1972. Naturalized flows were generated for the comparison, and ice‐affected backwater profiles were calculated along jams of varying length and location and for different combinations of model parameters and boundary conditions. Results show significant differences in backwater staging (~2 m for a return period of T = 1:10 year) between two study time periods (1973–1992 vs 1993–2012) as compared with two different hydraulic flow conditions (regulated vs naturalized), suggesting a larger role of climate than regulation in backwater staging. However, regulation was found to offset flood risk during the 1973–1992 period and exacerbate flood risk during the 1993–2012 period.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.192.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Drought is a recurring extreme climate event and among the mostcostly natural disasters in the world. This is particularly true over Canada,where drought is both a frequent and damaging phenomenon with impacts onregional water resources, agriculture, industry, aquatic ecosystems, andhealth. However, nationwide drought assessments are currently lacking andimpacted by limited ground-based observations. This study provides acomprehensive analysis of historical droughts over the whole of Canada,including the role of large-scale teleconnections. Drought events arecharacterized by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index(SPEI) over various temporal scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 consecutive months,6 months from April to September, and 12 months from October to September)applied to different gridded monthly data sets for the period 1950–2013.The Mann–Kendall test, rotated empirical orthogonal function, continuouswavelet transform, and wavelet coherence analyses are used, respectively, toinvestigate the trend, spatio-temporal patterns, periodicity, andteleconnectivity of drought events. Results indicate that southern (northern)parts of the country experienced significant trends towards drier (wetter)conditions although substantial variability exists. Two spatiallywell-defined regions with different temporal evolution of droughts wereidentified – the Canadian Prairies and northern central Canada. The analysesalso revealed the presence of a dominant periodicity of between 8 and 32 months in the Prairie region and between 8 and 40 months in the northern centralregion. These cycles of low-frequency variability are found to be associatedprincipally with the Pacific–North American (PNA) and Multivariate ElNiño/Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) relative to other consideredlarge-scale climate indices. This study is the first of its kind to identifydominant periodicities in drought variability over the whole of Canada interms of when the drought events occur, their duration, and how often they occur.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2018.GWF-1.79.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This is particularly true over Canada, where drought is both a frequent and damaging phenomenon with impacts on regional water resources, agriculture, industry, aquatic ecosystems and health. However, nation-wide drought assessments are currently lacking and impacted by limited ground-based observations. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of historical droughts over the whole of Canada, including the role of large-scale teleconnections. Drought events are characterized by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) over various temporal scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 consecutive months, 6 months from April to September, and 12 months from October to September) applied to different gridded monthly data sets for the period 1950–2013. The Mann Kendall test, Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function, Continuous Wavelet Transform, and Wavelet Coherence analyses are used, respectively, to investigate the trend, spatiotemporal patterns, periodicity, and teleconnectivity of drought events. Results indicate that southern (northern) parts of the country experienced significant trends towards drier (wetter) conditions although substantial variability exists. Two spatially well-defined regions with different temporal evolution of droughts were identified―the Canadian Prairies and Northern-central Canada. The analyses also revealed the presence of a dominant periodicity of between 8–32 months in the Prairie region, and 8–40 months in the Northern central region. These cycles of low-frequency variability are found to be associated principally to the Pacific-North American (PNA) and Multivariate El Nino/Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) relative to other considered large-scale climate indices. This study is the first of its kind to identify dominant periodicities in drought variability over the whole of Canada in terms of when the drought events occur, the duration, and how often they do so.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.47.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, researchinto the consistency of these products for various regions has been limitedand in many cases non-existent. This study inter-compares several griddedprecipitation products over 15 terrestrial ecozones in Canada for differentseasons. The spatial and temporal variability of the errors (relative tostation observations) was quantified over the period of 1979 to 2012 at a0.5° and daily spatio-temporal resolution. These datasetswere assessed in their ability to represent the daily variability ofprecipitation amounts by four performance measures: percentage of bias,root mean square error, correlation coefficient, and standard deviationratio. Results showed that most of the datasets were relatively skilful incentral Canada. However, they tended to overestimate precipitation amountsin the west and underestimate in the north and east, with theunderestimation being particularly dominant in northern Canada (above60° N). The global product by WATCH Forcing DataERA-Interim (WFDEI) augmented by Global Precipitation Climatology Centre(GPCC) data (WFDEI [GPCC]) performed best with respect to different metrics.The Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) product performed comparably withWFDEI [GPCC]; however, it only provides data starting in 2002. All thedatasets performed best in summer, followed by autumn, spring, and winter inorder of decreasing quality. Findings from this study can provide guidanceto potential users regarding the performance of different precipitationproducts for a range of geographical regions and time periods.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=B.+Bonsal" title="Search for 'B.
