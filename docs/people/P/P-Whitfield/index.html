We focus on the Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling‐Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (a) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (b) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (c) to prescribe the further research that is, needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large‐sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.76.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Probabilistic methods are useful to estimate theuncertainty in spatial meteorological fields (e.g., the uncertainty inspatial patterns of precipitation and temperature across large domains). Inensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members areused to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, ofa spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the availableinformation. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact ofuncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications.This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America(EMDNA). EMDNA has 100 ensemble members with daily precipitation amount,mean daily temperature, and daily temperature range at 0.1∘spatial resolution (approx. 10 km grids) from 1979 to 2018, derived from afusion of station observations and reanalysis model outputs. The stationdata used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America(SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements usingmultiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded,corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimalinterpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates.EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated randomfields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) themerged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates,particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimatesare more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regressionestimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident insparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performanceaccording to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. Wediscuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that furtherresearch is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall,EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorologicalapplications in North America. The entire dataset and a teaser dataset (asmall subset of EMDNA for easy download and preview) are available athttps://doi.org/10.20383/101.0275 (Tang et al., 2020a).</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.196.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Future increases in temperature and changes in precipitation will affect both snow accumulation and seasonal runoff timing and magnitude, but the underlying and fundamental roles of mountain basin geometry and hypsometry on snowmelt sensitivity have received little attention. To investigate the role of basin geometry in snowmelt sensitivity, a linear snow accumulation model and the Cold Regions Hydrological Modeling (CRHM) platform driven are used to estimate how hypsometry affects basin-wide snow volumes and snowmelt runoff. Area-elevation distributions for fifty basins in western Canada were extracted, normalized according to their elevation statistics, and classified into three clusters that represent top-heavy, middle, and bottom-heavy basins. Prescribed changes in air temperature alter both the snow accumulation gradient and the total snowmelt energy, leading to snowpack volume reductions (10–40%), earlier melt onsets (1–4 weeks) and end of melt season (3 weeks), increases in early spring melt rates and reductions in seasonal areal melt rates (up to 50%). Basin hypsometry controls the magnitude of the basin response. The most sensitive basins are bottom-heavy, and have a greater proportion of their area at low elevations. The least sensitive basins are top-heavy, and have a greater proportion of their area at high elevations. Basins with similar proportional areas at high and low elevations fall in between the others in terms of sensitivity and other metrics. This work provides context for anticipating the impacts of ongoing hydrological change due to climate change, and provides guidance for both monitoring networks and distributed modeling efforts.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.180.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In a warming climate, precipitation may occur as rainfall in mountainous areas. Detecting changes during seasonal transitions is difficult because these may encompass changes in timing, magnitude and phase, which may not be consistent between years. In this study, a sampling window from September to December is used to assess trends in magnitude, frequency and duration (of rainfall, snowfall and runoff events) in 127 climate stations and 128 watersheds with more than 30 years of record across the Rocky Mountains of North America. Rainfall events have increasing frequencies and durations, and magnitude trends are predominantly increasing at mid-latitude and mid-elevation. Snowfall events have the largest numbers of significant trends, with both increasing and decreasing trends in each of magnitude, frequency and duration. Snowfall events have decreasing frequencies and durations in the northern low-elevation sites and increasing frequencies and durations at the southern high-elevation sites. Trends in runoff events are less common than for rainfall and snowfall but are greater than expected by chance, and show similar frequency and duration patterns to snowfall trends. Snowfall and runoff events are decreasing in frequency and duration north of Wyoming and increasing to the south. Snowfall magnitude is generally decreasing to the north and increasing to the south, with runoff magnitude trends showing the reverse.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.181.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Hydrological processes are widely understood to be sensitive to changes in climate, but the effects of changes in vegetation and soils have seldom been considered. The response of mountain hydrology to future climate and vegetation/soil changes is modelled in three snowmelt dominated mountain basins in the North American Cordillera. A Cold Regions Hydrological Model developed for each basin was driven with perturbed observed meteorological time series. Monthly perturbations were developed from differences in eleven regional climate model outputs between the present and future scenarios. Future climate change in these basins results in decreased modelled peak snow water equivalent (SWE) but increased evapotranspiration in all basins. All three watersheds became more rainfall-dominated. In Wolf Creek in the Yukon Territory, an insignificant increasing effect of vegetation change on peak SWE was found to be important enough to offset the significant climate change effect on alpine snow. In Marmot Creek in the Canadian Rockies, a combined effect of soil and climate changes on increasing annual runoff becomes significant while their individual effects are not statistically significant. In the relatively warmer Reynolds Mountain East catchment in Idaho, USA, only vegetation change decreases annual runoff volume and changes in soil, climate, or combination of them do not affect runoff. At high elevations in Wolf and Marmot Creeks, modelled vegetation/soil changes moderated the impact of climate change on peak SWE, the timing of peak SWE, evapotranspiration, and annual runoff volume. At medium elevations, these changes intensified the impact of climate change, decreasing peak SWE, and sublimation. The modelled hydrological impacts of changes in climate, vegetation, and soil in mountain environments are similar in magnitude but not consistently in the direction in all biomes; in some combinations, this results in enhanced impacts at lower elevations and latitudes and offsetting effects at higher elevations and latitudes.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.164.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Here, three North American Cordilleran snow-dominated basins—Wolf Creek, Yukon; Marmot Creek, Alberta; and Reynolds Mountain East, Idaho—each with good meteorological and hydrological records, were modeled using the physically based, spatially distributed Cold Regions Hydrological Model. Model performance was verified using field observations and found adequate for diagnostic analysis. To diagnose the effects of future climate, the monthly temperature and precipitation changes projected for the future by 11 regional climate models for the mid-twenty-first century were added to the observed meteorological time series. The modeled future was warmer and wetter, increasing the rainfall fraction of precipitation and shifting all three basins toward rainfall–runoff hydrology. This shift was largest at lower elevations and in the relatively warmer Reynolds Mountain East. In the warmer future, there was decreased blowing snow transport, snow interception and sublimation, peak snow accumulation, and melt rates, and increased evapotranspiration and the duration of the snow-free season. Annual runoff in these basins did not change despite precipitation increases, warming, and an increased prominence of rainfall over snowfall. Reduced snow sublimation offset reduced snowfall amounts, and increased evapotranspiration offset increased rainfall amounts. The hydrological uncertainty due to variation among climate models was greater than the predicted hydrological changes. While the results of this study can be used to assess the vulnerability and resiliency of water resources that are dependent on mountain snow, stakeholders and water managers must make decisions under considerable uncertainty, which this paper illustrates.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.46.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The assessment inspects the early and operational history, the published streamflow record and the stage-discharge measurements collected since 1909. Methods used to estimate pre-operational high flows and the operational history are reviewed to establish potential issues with changes in technology, location and measurement sections. The streamflow record is screened for discontinuities and change. The stage-discharge measurements used to establish the rating curve for open-water and ice-covered periods are assessed and used to establish the degree of support for the published data over the period of record. In the period 1882 to 1909, occasional high-stage estimates were used to estimate peak discharge, but with considerable uncertainty due to lack of stream velocity measurements and bed profiles. For the period 1909–1914 it is difficult to confirm the validity of the data as benchmarks and gauge corrections are unclear. Since 1922 when the station was established in its present location, many changes in the technology used for recording stage and measuring discharge have occurred. Rating curve support for high and low flows has varied over the period of record, particularly after cableway measurements of high flows were recently abandoned. Several important quality issues were identified that may require user caution, most notably an inconsistency with respect to the recording of winter ice-cover. These changes and issues have not affected the quality of the record in any substantial way. The stability of the flow control has remained remarkably consistent, resulting in high data quality for most of the period of record.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=P.+Whitfield" title="Search for 'P.
