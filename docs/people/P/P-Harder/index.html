Vegetation has a tremendous influence on snow processesand snowpack dynamics, yet remote sensing techniques to resolve the spatialvariability of sub-canopy snow depth are not always available and aredifficult from space-based platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) havehad recent widespread application to capture high-resolution information onsnow processes and are herein applied to the sub-canopy snow depthchallenge. Previous demonstrations of snow depth mapping with UAV structurefrom motion (SfM) and airborne lidar have focussed on non-vegetated surfacesor reported large errors in the presence of vegetation. In contrast,UAV-lidar systems have high-density point clouds and measure returns from awide range of scan angles, increasing the likelihood of successfully sensingthe sub-canopy snow depth. The effectiveness of UAV lidar and UAV SfM inmapping snow depth in both open and forested terrain was tested in a 2019field campaign at the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory, Alberta, andat Canadian prairie sites near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. OnlyUAV lidar could successfully measure the sub-canopy snow surface withreliable sub-canopy point coverage and consistent error metrics(root mean square error (RMSE) &lt;0.17 m and bias −0.03 to −0.13 m). Relative to UAV lidar, UAV SfMdid not consistently sense the sub-canopy snow surface, the interpolationneeded to account for point cloud gaps introduced interpolation artefacts,and error metrics demonstrated relatively large variability (RMSE&lt;0.33 m and bias 0.08 to −0.14 m). With the demonstration of sub-canopy snowdepth mapping capabilities, a number of early applications are presented toshowcase the ability of UAV lidar to effectively quantify the manymultiscale snow processes defining snowpack dynamics in mountain and prairieenvironments.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.73.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Local-scale advection of energy from warm snow-free surfaces to coldsnow-covered surfaces is an important component of the energy balance duringsnow-cover depletion. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to quantify inone-dimensional snowmelt models. This paper proposes a simple sensible andlatent heat advection model for snowmelt situations that can be readilycoupled to one-dimensional energy balance snowmelt models. An existingadvection parameterization was coupled to a conceptual frozen soilinfiltration surface water retention model to estimate the areal averagesensible and latent heat advection contributions to snowmelt. The proposedmodel compared well with observations of latent and sensible heat advection,providing confidence in the process parameterizations and the assumptionsapplied. Snow-covered area observations from unmanned aerial vehicle imagerywere used to update and evaluate the scaling properties of snow patch areadistribution and lengths. Model dynamics and snowmelt implications wereexplored within an idealized modelling experiment, by coupling to aone-dimensional energy balance snowmelt model. Dry, snow-free surfaces wereassociated with advection of dry air that compensated for positive sensibleheat advection fluxes and so limited the net influence of advection onsnowmelt. Latent and sensible heat advection fluxes both contributed positivefluxes to snow when snow-free surfaces were wet and enhanced net advectioncontributions to snowmelt. The increased net advection fluxes from wetsurfaces typically develop towards the end of snowmelt and offset decreasesin the one-dimensional areal average melt energy that declines withsnow-covered area. The new model can be readily incorporated into existingone-dimensional snowmelt hydrology and land surface scheme models and willfoster improvements in snowmelt understanding and predictions.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.238.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Melting agricultural snowcovers are patchy, which leads to melt rate enhancement by energy advection from warm moist snow-free surfaces to cool dry snowcovers. Agricultural snowmelt is also impacted by crop residue. Adoption of zero-tillage agricultural practices means vast areas of the Canadian Prairies are now characterized by standing crop stubble. Stubble influences snow accumulation through blowing snow processes and snowmelt through the impact of emerging stubble upon the surface energy balance. Unfortunately, stubble emergence and advection to patchy snowcovers are unaccounted for in snow hydrology models and a complete process description has been unavailable. Here, both advection and stubble influences on snowmelt hydrology are modelled by coupling new stubble-snow-atmosphere surface energy balance and advection models to existing blowing snow and frozen soil infiltration models. Long-term meteorological datasets from sub-humid and semi-arid locations in Saskatchewan, Canada are used to quantify the influence of stubble characteristics on accumulation, melt, and meltwater partitioning processes with respect to interannual variability, antecedent soil moisture, and climatic differences on the Canadian Prairies. The hydrological response to increasing stubble height is increased meltwater, melt rate, infiltration, and runoff, and negligible changes in melt duration. The response of these processes to changes in stubble height was more pronounced at a semi-arid site versus a sub-humid site as stubble more effectively suppresses blowing snow sublimation in the windier, drier semi-arid environment of southwestern Saskatchewan. Recommendations for stubble management to meet specific runoff or infiltration objectives are summarised; stubble management can be an effective tool to influence infiltration where soils are dry and runoff where soils are wet. This framework allows the diagnosis of the influence of stubble management on meltwater partitioning in cold agricultural regions.</div></div><h4>2018</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2018.GWF-1.52.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The importance of stubble in trapping wind-blown snow and retaining winter snowfall has been well demonstrated. However, stubble is not explicitly accounted for in hydrological or energy balance snowmelt models. This paper relates measurable stubble parameters (height, width, areal density, and albedo) to the snowpack energy balance and snowmelt with the new, physically based Stubble–Snow–Atmosphere Model (SSAM). Novel process representations of SSAM quantify the attenuation of shortwave radiation by exposed stubble, the sky and vegetation view factors needed to solve longwave radiation terms, and a resistance scheme for stubble–snow–atmosphere fluxes to solve for surface temperatures and turbulent fluxes. SSAM results were compared to observations of radiometric snow-surface temperature, stubble temperature, snow-surface solar irradiance, areal-average turbulent fluxes, and snow water equivalent from two intensive field campaigns during snowmelt in 2015 and 2016 over wheat and canola stubble in Saskatchewan, Canada. Uncalibrated SSAM simulations compared well with these observations, providing confidence in the model structure and parameterization. A sensitivity analysis conducted using SSAM revealed compensatory relationships in energy balance terms that result in a small increase in net snowpack energy as stubble exposure increases.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.18.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Energy exchange with the atmosphere is therefore complicated by horizontal gradients in surface temperature and humidity as snow surface temperature and humidity are regulated by the phase change of melting snow unlike snow‐free areas. Airflow across these surface transitions results in local‐scale advection of energy that has been documented as sensible heat during snowmelt, while latent heat advection has received scant attention. Herein, results are presented from an experiment measuring near‐surface profiles of air temperature and humidity across snow‐free to snow‐covered transitions that demonstrates that latent heat advection can be the same order of magnitude as sensible heat advection and is therefore an important source of snowmelt energy. Latent heat advection is conditional on an upwind source of water vapor from a wetted snow‐free surface.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=P.+Harder" title="Search for 'P.
