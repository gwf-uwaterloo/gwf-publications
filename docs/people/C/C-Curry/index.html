This study examines differences for Canada and six sub-regions between simulations from the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and its predecessor CMIP5. Ensembles from both experiments are assessed using a set of derived indices calculated from daily precipitation and temperature, with projections compared at fixed future time intervals and fixed levels of global temperature change. For changes calculated at fixed time intervals most temperature indices display higher projected changes in CMIP6 than CMIP5 for most sub-regions, while greater precipitation changes in CMIP6 occur mainly in extreme precipitation indices. When future projections are calculated at fixed levels of global average temperature increase, the size and spread of differences for future projected changes between CMIP6 and CMIP5 are substantially reduced for most indices. Temperature scaling behaviour, or the regional response to increasing global temperatures, is similar in both ensembles, with annual temperature anomalies for Canada and its sub-regions increasing at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the rate of increase globally, depending on the region. The CMIP6 ensemble projections exhibit modestly stronger scaling behaviour for temperature anomalies in northern Canada, as well as for certain indices of moderate and extreme events. Such temperature scaling differences persist even if anomalously warm CMIP6 global climate models are omitted. Comparing the mean and variance of future projections for Canada in CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations from the same modelling centre suggests CMIP6 models are significantly warmer in Canada than CMIP5 models at the same level of forcing, with some evidence that internal temperature variability in CMIP6 is reduced compared with CMIP5.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.50.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Hydroclimate projections in such basins often find reductions in annual peak runoff due to decreased snowpack under global warming. British Columbia's Fraser River Basin (FRB) is a large, nival basin with exposure to moisture‐laden atmospheric rivers originating in the Pacific Ocean. Landfalling atmospheric rivers over the region in winter are projected to increase in both strength and frequency in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models. We investigate future changes in hydrology and annual peak daily streamflow in the FRB using a hydrologic model driven by a bias‐corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (8.5), the FRB evolves toward a nival‐pluvial regime featuring an increasing association of extreme rainfall with annual peak daily flow, a doubling in cold season peak discharge, and a decrease in the return period of the largest historical flow, from a 1‐in‐200‐year to 1‐in‐50‐year event by the late 21st century.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.82.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In response to ongoing and future-projected global warming, mid-latitude,nival river basins are expected to transition from a snowmelt-dominated flowregime to a nival–pluvial one with an earlier spring freshet of reducedmagnitude. There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends onfactors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength ofmaritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritimeinfluence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in theFraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershedextending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use aprocess-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statisticallydownscaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5(CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening theaverage snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, largeincreases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peakflows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations.Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driverin the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoffchanges in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basinincreases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more thandoubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges foroperational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of thebasin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990sto a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmeltpulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with theanticipated transition from a nival to a nival–pluvial hydrologic regime,the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to morefrequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5models, providing insights for other maritime-influenced extratropicalbasins.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.12.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia is one of the largest andmost important watersheds in western North America, and home to a richdiversity of biological species and economic assets that depend implicitlyupon its extensive riverine habitats. The hydrology of the FRB is dominatedby snow accumulation and melt processes, leading to a prominent annual peakstreamflow invariably occurring in May–July. Nevertheless, while annual peakdaily streamflow (APF) during the spring freshet in the FRB is historicallywell correlated with basin-averaged, 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE),there are numerous occurrences of anomalously large APF in below- ornear-normal SWE years, some of which have resulted in damaging floods in theregion. An imperfect understanding of which other climatic factors contributeto these anomalously large APFs hinders robust projections of their magnitudeand frequency. We employ the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) process-based hydrologicalmodel driven by gridded observations to investigate the key controllingfactors of anomalous APF events in the FRB and four of its subbasins thatcontribute nearly 70 % of the annual flow at Fraser-Hope. The relativeinfluence of a set of predictors characterizing the interannual variabilityof rainfall, snowfall, snowpack (characterized by the annual maximum value,SWE max ), soil moisture and temperature on simulated APF at Hope(the main outlet of the FRB) and at the subbasin outlets is examined within aregression framework. The influence of large-scale climate modes ofvariability (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and theEl Nino–Southern Oscillation – ENSO) on APF magnitude is also assessed,and placed in context with these more localized controls. The resultsindicate that next to SWE max (univariate Spearman correlationwith APF of ρ ^ =  0.64; 0.70 (observations; VIC simulation)),the snowmelt rate ( ρ ^ =  0.43 in VIC), the ENSO and PDO indices( ρ ^ = − 0.40; − 0.41) and ( ρ ^ = − 0.35; − 0.38), respectively, and rate of warming subsequent to the date ofSWE max ( ρ ^ =  0.26; 0.38), are the most influentialpredictors of APF magnitude in the FRB and its subbasins. The identificationof these controls on annual peak flows in the region may be of use inunderstanding seasonal predictions or future projected streamflow changes.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=C.+Curry" title="Search for 'C.
