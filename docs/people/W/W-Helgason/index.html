Consequently, inconsistencies arise between WUE calculations due to complex physical and physiological interactions. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare WUE estimates (harvest or flux-based) for alfalfa (C3 plant) and maize (C4 plant) and determine effects of input variables, plant physiology and farming practices on estimates. Four WUE calculations were investigated: two “harvest-based” methods, using above ground carbon content and either precipitation or evapotranspiration (ET), and two “flux-based” methods, using gross primary productivity (GPP) and either ET or transpiration. WUE estimates differed based on method used at both half-hourly and seasonal scales. Input variables used in calculations affected WUE estimates, and plant physiology led to different responses in carbon assimilation and water use variables. WUE estimates were also impacted by different plant physiological responses and processing methods, even when the same carbon assimilation and water use variables were considered. This study highlights a need to develop a metric of measuring cropland carbon-water coupling that accounts for all water use components, plant carbon responses, and biomass production.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.107.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

One source of uncertainty is the timing and drivers of the spring transition. Remote sensing can provide important information on this transition, but persistent foliage greenness, seasonal snow cover, and a high prevalence of mixed forest stands (both deciduous and evergreen species) complicate interpretation of these signals. We collected tower‐based remotely sensed data (reflectance‐based vegetation indices and Solar‐Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence [SIF]), stem radius measurements, gross primary productivity, and environmental conditions in a boreal mixed forest stand. Evaluation of this data set shows a two‐phased spring transition. The first phase is the reactivation of photosynthesis and transpiration in evergreens, marked by an increase in relative SIF, and is triggered by thawed stems, warm air temperatures, and increased available soil moisture. The second phase is a reduction in bulk photoprotective pigments in evergreens, marked by an increase in the Chlorophyll‐Carotenoid Index. Deciduous leaf‐out occurs during this phase, marked by an increase in all remotely sensed metrics. The second phase is controlled by soil thaw. Our results demonstrate that remote sensing metrics can be used to detect specific physiological changes in boreal tree species during the spring transition. The two‐phased transition explains inconsistencies in remote sensing estimates of the timing and drivers of spring recovery. Our results imply that satellite‐based observations will improve by using a combination of vegetation indices and SIF, along with species distribution information.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.185.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Despite this, very few ABL observations are available over mountain glaciers in complex terrain. An intensive field campaign was conducted in June 2015 at the Athabasca Glacier outlet of Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rockies. Observations of wind and temperature profiles with novel kite and radio‐acoustic sounding systems showed a well‐defined mesoscale circulation developed between the glacier and snow‐free valley in fair weather. The typical vertical ABL structure above the glacier differed from that expected for “glacier winds”; strong daytime down‐glacier winds extended through the lowest 200 m with no up‐valley return flow aloft. This structure suggests external forcing at mesoscale scales or greater and is provisionally termed an “icefield breeze.” A wind speed maximum near the surface, characteristic of a “glacier wind,” was only observed during night‐time and one afternoon. Lapse rates of air temperature down the glacier centerline show the interaction of down‐glacier cooling driven by sensible heat loss into the ice, entrainment and periodic disruption and warming. Down‐glacier cooling was weaker in “icefield breeze” conditions, while in “glacier wind” conditions, stronger down‐glacier cooling enabled large increases in near‐surface temperature on the lower glacier during periods of surface boundary layer (SBL) disruption. These results raise several questions, including the impact of Columbia Icefield on the ABL and melt of Athabasca Glacier. Future work should use these observations as a testbed for modeling spatio‐temporal variations in the ABL and SBL within complex glaciated terrain.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.200.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades.Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate–land–hydrologicalsystems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrologicalmodels. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and basepredictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions ofnon-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the futureand system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefrontin the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), whichassembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise toimprove the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation andexperimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins andother sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality andprocess representation, based on this improved understanding, within thefine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and thelarge-scale Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) – Surfaceand Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, appliedunder past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historicalchange and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second oftwo articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to theatmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.2.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Despite recent progress in modeling dynamic crop growth and irrigation in land surface models (LSMs), transitioning these models from field to regional scales is still challenging. This study applies the Noah‐MP LSM with dynamic crop‐growth and irrigation schemes to jointly simulate the crop yield and irrigation amount for corn and soybean in the central United States. The model performance of crop yield and irrigation amount are evaluated at county‐level against the USDA reports and USGS water withdrawal data, respectively. The bulk simulation (with uniform planting/harvesting management and no irrigation) produces significant biases in crop yield estimates for all planting regions, with root‐mean‐square‐errors (RMSEs) being 28.1% and 28.4% for corn and soybean, respectively. Without an irrigation scheme, the crop yields in the irrigated regions are reduced due to water stress with RMSEs of 48.7% and 20.5%. Applying a dynamic irrigation scheme effectively improves crop yields in irrigated regions and reduces RMSEs to 22.3% and 16.8%. In rainfed regions, the model overestimates crop yields. Applying spatially varied planting and harvesting dates at state‐level reduces crop yields and irrigation amount for both crops, especially in northern states. A “nitrogen‐stressed” simulation is conducted and found that the improvement of irrigation on crop yields is limited when the crops are under nitrogen stress. Several uncertainties in modeling crop growth are identified, including yield‐gap, planting date, rubisco capacity, and discrepancies between available data sets, pointing to future efforts to incorporating spatially varying crop parameters to better constrain crop growing seasons.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.19.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Vegetation has a tremendous influence on snow processesand snowpack dynamics, yet remote sensing techniques to resolve the spatialvariability of sub-canopy snow depth are not always available and aredifficult from space-based platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) havehad recent widespread application to capture high-resolution information onsnow processes and are herein applied to the sub-canopy snow depthchallenge. Previous demonstrations of snow depth mapping with UAV structurefrom motion (SfM) and airborne lidar have focussed on non-vegetated surfacesor reported large errors in the presence of vegetation. In contrast,UAV-lidar systems have high-density point clouds and measure returns from awide range of scan angles, increasing the likelihood of successfully sensingthe sub-canopy snow depth. The effectiveness of UAV lidar and UAV SfM inmapping snow depth in both open and forested terrain was tested in a 2019field campaign at the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory, Alberta, andat Canadian prairie sites near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. OnlyUAV lidar could successfully measure the sub-canopy snow surface withreliable sub-canopy point coverage and consistent error metrics(root mean square error (RMSE) &lt;0.17 m and bias −0.03 to −0.13 m). Relative to UAV lidar, UAV SfMdid not consistently sense the sub-canopy snow surface, the interpolationneeded to account for point cloud gaps introduced interpolation artefacts,and error metrics demonstrated relatively large variability (RMSE&lt;0.33 m and bias 0.08 to −0.14 m). With the demonstration of sub-canopy snowdepth mapping capabilities, a number of early applications are presented toshowcase the ability of UAV lidar to effectively quantify the manymultiscale snow processes defining snowpack dynamics in mountain and prairieenvironments.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.73.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Local-scale advection of energy from warm snow-free surfaces to coldsnow-covered surfaces is an important component of the energy balance duringsnow-cover depletion. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to quantify inone-dimensional snowmelt models. This paper proposes a simple sensible andlatent heat advection model for snowmelt situations that can be readilycoupled to one-dimensional energy balance snowmelt models. An existingadvection parameterization was coupled to a conceptual frozen soilinfiltration surface water retention model to estimate the areal averagesensible and latent heat advection contributions to snowmelt. The proposedmodel compared well with observations of latent and sensible heat advection,providing confidence in the process parameterizations and the assumptionsapplied. Snow-covered area observations from unmanned aerial vehicle imagerywere used to update and evaluate the scaling properties of snow patch areadistribution and lengths. Model dynamics and snowmelt implications wereexplored within an idealized modelling experiment, by coupling to aone-dimensional energy balance snowmelt model. Dry, snow-free surfaces wereassociated with advection of dry air that compensated for positive sensibleheat advection fluxes and so limited the net influence of advection onsnowmelt. Latent and sensible heat advection fluxes both contributed positivefluxes to snow when snow-free surfaces were wet and enhanced net advectioncontributions to snowmelt. The increased net advection fluxes from wetsurfaces typically develop towards the end of snowmelt and offset decreasesin the one-dimensional areal average melt energy that declines withsnow-covered area. The new model can be readily incorporated into existingone-dimensional snowmelt hydrology and land surface scheme models and willfoster improvements in snowmelt understanding and predictions.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.238.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Melting agricultural snowcovers are patchy, which leads to melt rate enhancement by energy advection from warm moist snow-free surfaces to cool dry snowcovers. Agricultural snowmelt is also impacted by crop residue. Adoption of zero-tillage agricultural practices means vast areas of the Canadian Prairies are now characterized by standing crop stubble. Stubble influences snow accumulation through blowing snow processes and snowmelt through the impact of emerging stubble upon the surface energy balance. Unfortunately, stubble emergence and advection to patchy snowcovers are unaccounted for in snow hydrology models and a complete process description has been unavailable. Here, both advection and stubble influences on snowmelt hydrology are modelled by coupling new stubble-snow-atmosphere surface energy balance and advection models to existing blowing snow and frozen soil infiltration models. Long-term meteorological datasets from sub-humid and semi-arid locations in Saskatchewan, Canada are used to quantify the influence of stubble characteristics on accumulation, melt, and meltwater partitioning processes with respect to interannual variability, antecedent soil moisture, and climatic differences on the Canadian Prairies. The hydrological response to increasing stubble height is increased meltwater, melt rate, infiltration, and runoff, and negligible changes in melt duration. The response of these processes to changes in stubble height was more pronounced at a semi-arid site versus a sub-humid site as stubble more effectively suppresses blowing snow sublimation in the windier, drier semi-arid environment of southwestern Saskatchewan. Recommendations for stubble management to meet specific runoff or infiltration objectives are summarised; stubble management can be an effective tool to influence infiltration where soils are dry and runoff where soils are wet. This framework allows the diagnosis of the influence of stubble management on meltwater partitioning in cold agricultural regions.</div></div><h4>2018</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2018.GWF-1.38.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This study has investigated the challenges in specifying the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat to snowpacks in forest clearings. The snowpack in two forest clearings in the Canadian Rockies was simulated using a one-dimensional (1D) snowpack model. A trade-off was found between optimizing against measured snow surface temperature or snowmelt when choosing how to specify the turbulent fluxes. Schemes using the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory tended to produce negatively biased surface temperature, while schemes that enhanced turbulent fluxes, to reduce the surface temperature bias, resulted in too much melt. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo experiments showed that no realistic parameter set could successfully remove biases in both surface temperature and melt. A simple scheme that excludes atmospheric stability correction was required to successfully simulate surface temperature under low wind speed conditions. Nonturbulent advective fluxes and/or nonlocal sources of turbulence are thought to account for the maintenance of heat exchange in low-wind conditions. The simulation of snowmelt was improved by allowing enhanced latent heat fluxes during low-wind conditions. Caution is warranted when snowpack models are optimized on surface temperature, as model tuning may compensate for deficiencies in conceptual and numerical models of radiative, conductive, and turbulent heat exchange at the snow surface and within the snowpack. Such model tuning could have large impacts on the melt rate and timing of the snow-free transition in simulations of forest clearings within hydrological and meteorological models.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2018.GWF-1.41.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The importance of stubble in trapping wind-blown snow and retaining winter snowfall has been well demonstrated. However, stubble is not explicitly accounted for in hydrological or energy balance snowmelt models. This paper relates measurable stubble parameters (height, width, areal density, and albedo) to the snowpack energy balance and snowmelt with the new, physically based Stubble–Snow–Atmosphere Model (SSAM). Novel process representations of SSAM quantify the attenuation of shortwave radiation by exposed stubble, the sky and vegetation view factors needed to solve longwave radiation terms, and a resistance scheme for stubble–snow–atmosphere fluxes to solve for surface temperatures and turbulent fluxes. SSAM results were compared to observations of radiometric snow-surface temperature, stubble temperature, snow-surface solar irradiance, areal-average turbulent fluxes, and snow water equivalent from two intensive field campaigns during snowmelt in 2015 and 2016 over wheat and canola stubble in Saskatchewan, Canada. Uncalibrated SSAM simulations compared well with these observations, providing confidence in the model structure and parameterization. A sensitivity analysis conducted using SSAM revealed compensatory relationships in energy balance terms that result in a small increase in net snowpack energy as stubble exposure increases.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.18.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Energy exchange with the atmosphere is therefore complicated by horizontal gradients in surface temperature and humidity as snow surface temperature and humidity are regulated by the phase change of melting snow unlike snow‐free areas. Airflow across these surface transitions results in local‐scale advection of energy that has been documented as sensible heat during snowmelt, while latent heat advection has received scant attention. Herein, results are presented from an experiment measuring near‐surface profiles of air temperature and humidity across snow‐free to snow‐covered transitions that demonstrates that latent heat advection can be the same order of magnitude as sensible heat advection and is therefore an important source of snowmelt energy. Latent heat advection is conditional on an upwind source of water vapor from a wetted snow‐free surface.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=W.+Helgason" title="Search for 'W.
