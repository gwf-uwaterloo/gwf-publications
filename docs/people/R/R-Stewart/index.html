Accumulations reached 75 cm, wind gusts exceeded 100 km h−1, and surface temperature (T) remained near 0°C (−1°C ≤ T ≤ 1°C) for up to 88 h. It produced the largest October snowfall and was the earliest to produce at least 20 cm since 1872 in Winnipeg. These factors led to unparalleled damage and power restoration challenges for Manitoba Hydro and, with leaves still largely on vegetation, the most damaging storm to Winnipeg’s trees ever recorded. The storm’s track was uncommon, and produced elevated convection related to buoyancy-driven instability and conditional symmetric instability (CSI), with a moist absolutely unstable layer (MAUL) near 500 hPa. Instabilities were released via lift through lower-tropospheric warm advection and frontogenesis, differential cyclonic vorticity advection, and jet streak dynamics. Precipitation bands, elevated convection, and lake effect snow bands enhanced local snowfall. Snow adhering to structures was not always wet but, when present, it sometimes occurred because of incomplete freezing of particles partially melted aloft in a near-surface (&lt;100 m deep) inversion. Although other storms over the historical record have produced a similar combination of severe precipitation, temperature and wind conditions, none have done this for such a long period.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2022.GWF-1.85.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The objective of the April-June 2019 Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE) was to determine the atmospheric processes producing precipitation on the eastern and western sides of the Canadian Rockies during springtime, a period when upslope events of variable phase dominate precipitation on the eastern slopes. To do so, three observing sites across the divide were instrumented with advanced meteorological sensors. During the 13 observed events, the western side recorded only 25% of the eastern side’s precipitation accumulation, rainfall occurred rather than snowfall, and skies were mainly clear. Moisture sources and amounts varied markedly between events. An atmospheric river landfall in California led to moisture flowing persistently northward and producing the longest duration of precipitation on both sides of the divide. Moisture from the continental interior always produced precipitation on the eastern side but only in specific conditions on the western side. Mainly slow-falling ice crystals, sometimes rimed, formed at higher elevations on the eastern side (> 3 km MSL), were lifted, and subsequently drifted westward over the divide during non-convective storms to produce rain at the surface on the western side. Overall, precipitation generally crossed the divide in the Canadian Rockies during specific spring-storm atmospheric conditions although amounts at the surface varied with elevation, condensate type, and local and large-scale flow fields.</div></div><h4>2021</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.152.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades.Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate–land–hydrologicalsystems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrologicalmodels. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and basepredictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions ofnon-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the futureand system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefrontin the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), whichassembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise toimprove the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation andexperimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins andother sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality andprocess representation, based on this improved understanding, within thefine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and thelarge-scale Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) – Surfaceand Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, appliedunder past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historicalchange and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second oftwo articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to theatmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.136.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The 0  ∘ C temperature threshold is critical formany meteorological and hydrological processes driven by melting andfreezing in the atmosphere, surface, and sub-surface and by the associatedprecipitation varying between rain, freezing rain, wet snow, and snow. Thisthreshold is especially important in cold regions such as Canada, because itis linked with freeze–thaw, snowmelt, and permafrost. This study develops aCanada-wide perspective on near-0  ∘ C conditions using hourlysurface temperature and precipitation type observations from 92 climatestations for the period from 1981 to 2011. In addition, nine stations fromvarious climatic regions are selected for further analysis. Near-0  ∘ C conditions are defined as periods when the surfacetemperature is between −2 and 2  ∘ C. Near-0  ∘ C conditions occur often across all regions of the country, although theannual number of days and hours and the duration of these events variesdramatically. Various types of precipitation (e.g., rain, freezingrain, wet snow, and ice pellets) sometimes occur with these temperatures. Near-0  ∘ C conditions and the reported precipitation typeoccurrences tend to be higher in Atlantic Canada, although high values alsooccur in other regions. Trends of most temperature-based andprecipitation-based indicators show little or no change despite a systematicwarming in annual surface temperatures over Canada. Over the annual cycle,near-0  ∘ C temperatures and precipitation often exhibit a pattern:short durations occur around summer, driven by the diurnal cycle, and a tendency toward longerdurations around winter, associated with storms. There isalso a tendency for near-0  ∘ C surface temperatures to occur moreoften than expected relative to other temperature windows at some stationsdue, at least in part, to diabatic cooling and heating that take place with meltingand freezing, respectively, in the atmosphere and at the surface.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.25.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Transitionregions, consisting of both liquid and solid precipitation or liquidprecipitation below 0 ∘C, occurred on 93 % and 94 % of thedays in the present and PGW future, respectively. This led to accumulatedprecipitation within the transition region increasing by 27 % and wasassociated with a rise in its average elevation by 374 m over the Coast Mountains andInsular Mountains and by 240 m over the Rocky Mountains and consequently toan eastward shift towards the higher terrain of the Rocky Mountains.Transition regions comprised of only rain and snow were most common underboth the CTRL and PGW simulations, although all seven transition regioncategories occurred.

This study assesses surface and atmospheric conditions associated with the 2014 extreme wildfires in the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada. Hot and dry conditions led to the NWT experiencing the most severe wildfire season in its recorded history. The season included a record number of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes and set a record for area burned. Lightning was the dominant ignition source and accounted for about 95% of the wildfires. Prolonged periods of smoke led to dramatic reductions in visibility, frequent road closures, and reduced air quality resulting in numerous health alerts. Temporal and spatial patterns of lightning characteristics in 2014, derived from Canadian Lightning Detection Network data, were different from those in other years with, for example, far more positive flashes from 0600 to 1200 utc (midnight to 6:00 am local time). The highest fraction of positive cloud-to-ground flashes (43.1%) occurred in the smoke-dominated North Slave region, which was more than in the Dehcho, South Slave, or Sahtu regions. Mid-tropospheric atmospheric circulation over a large region that included the NWT was classified into the six most common summer patterns. Results showed that ridging and ridge displacements occurred more frequently during 2014 although lightning was associated with all circulation patterns. This study has advanced the understanding of the roles of weather, lightning, and mid-tropospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme wildfires in northwestern Canada.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.192.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Precipitation events that bring rain and snow to theBanff–Calgary area of Alberta are a critical aspect of the region's watercycle and can lead to major flooding events such as the June 2013 event thatwas the second most costly natural disaster in Canadian history. Because nospecial atmospheric-oriented observations of these events have been made, afield experiment was conducted in March and April 2015 in Kananaskis,Alberta, to begin to fill this gap. The goal was to characterize and betterunderstand the formation of the precipitation at the surface duringspring 2015 at a specific location in the Kananaskis Valley. Within theexperiment, detailed measurements of precipitation and weather conditionswere obtained, a vertically pointing Doppler radar was deployed and weatherballoons were released. Although 17 precipitation events occurred, thisperiod was associated with much less precipitation than normal (−35 %)and above-normal temperatures (2.5 ∘C). Of the 133 h of observedprecipitation, solid precipitation occurred 71 % of the time, mixedprecipitation occurred 9 % and rain occurred 20 %. An analysis of17 504 precipitation particles from 1181 images showed that a wide varietyof crystals and aggregates occurred and approximately 63 % showed signs ofriming. This was largely independent of whether flows aloft were upslope(easterly) or downslope (westerly). In the often sub-saturated surfaceconditions, hydrometeors containing ice occurred at temperatures as high as9 ∘C. Radar structures aloft were highly variable with reflectivitysometimes >30 dBZe and Doppler velocity up to −1 m s−1, whichindicates upward motion of particles within ascending air masses.Precipitation was formed in this region within cloud fields sometimes havingvariable structures and within which supercooled water at least sometimesexisted to produce accreted particles massive enough to reach the surfacethrough the relatively dry sub-cloud region.</div></div><h4>2017</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2017.GWF-1.23.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The long-lived, heavy rainfall event was a result of complex interplays between topographic, synoptic, and convective processes that rendered an accurate simulation of this event a challenging task. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model was used to simulate this event and was validated against several observation datasets. Both the timing and location of the model precipitation agree closely with the observations, indicating that the WRF Model is capable of reproducing this type of severe event. Sensitivity tests with different microphysics schemes were conducted and evaluated using equitable threat and bias frequency scores. The WRF double-moment 6-class microphysics scheme (WDM6) generally performed better when compared with other schemes. The application of a conventional convective/stratiform separation algorithm shows that convective activity was dominant during ...</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=R.+Stewart" title="Search for 'R.
