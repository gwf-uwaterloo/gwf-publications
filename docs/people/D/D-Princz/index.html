Hydrological models have a key role in predicting changing water resources but are challenged in cold regions. Ground‐based data to quantify meteorological forcing and constrain model parameterization are limited, while hydrological processes are complex, often controlled by phase change energetics.

This paper discusses the scientific and technical challenges of the large‐scale modelling of cold region systems and reports recent modelling developments, focussing on MESH, the Canadian community hydrological land surface scheme. New cold region process representations include improved blowing snow transport and sublimation, lateral land‐surface flow, prairie pothole pond storage dynamics, frozen ground infiltration and thermodynamics, and improved glacier modelling. New algorithms to represent water management include multistage reservoir operation. Parameterization has been supported by field observations and remotely sensed data; new methods for parameter identification have been used to evaluate model uncertainty and support regionalization. Additionally, MESH has been linked to broader decision‐support frameworks, including river ice simulation and hydrological forecasting. The paper also reports various applications to the Saskatchewan and Mackenzie River basins in western Canada (0.4 and 1.8 million km2). These basins arise in glaciated mountain headwaters, are partly underlain by permafrost, and include remote and incompletely understood forested, wetland, agricultural and tundra ecoregions. These illustrate the current capabilities and limitations of cold region modelling, and the extraordinary challenges to prediction, including the need to overcoming biases in forcing data sets, which can have disproportionate effects on the simulated hydrology.</div></div><h4>2021</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.15.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This study is the third in a sequence of the Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Projects. The densely populated Lake Erie watershed studied here is an important international lake that has experienced recent flooding and shoreline erosion alongside excessive nutrient loads that have contributed to lake eutrophication. Understanding the sources and pathways of flows is critical to solve the complex issues facing this watershed. Seventeen hydrologic and land-surface models of different complexity are set up over this domain using the same meteorological forcings, and their simulated streamflows at 46 calibration and seven independent validation stations are compared. Results show that: (1) the good performance of Machine Learning models during calibration decreases significantly in validation due to the limited amount of training data; (2) models calibrated at individual stations perform equally well in validation; and (3) most distributed models calibrated over the entire domain have problems in simulating urban areas but outperform the other models in validation.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.80.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Cold region hydrology is very sensitive to the impacts of climate warming.Impacts of warming over recent decades in western Canada include glacierretreat, permafrost thaw, and changing patterns of precipitation, with anincreased proportion of winter precipitation falling as rainfall and shorter durations of snow cover, as well as consequent changes in flow regimes. Future warming is expected to continue along these lines. Physically realistic andsophisticated hydrological models driven by reliable climate forcing canprovide the capability to assess hydrological responses to climate change.However, the provision of reliable forcing data remains problematic,particularly in data-sparse regions. Hydrological processes in cold regionsinvolve complex phase changes and so are very sensitive to small biases inthe driving meteorology, particularly in temperature and precipitation,including precipitation phase. Cold regions often have sparse surfaceobservations, particularly at high elevations that generate a large amountof runoff. This paper aims to provide an improved set of forcing data forlarge-scale hydrological models for climate change impact assessment. Thebest available gridded data in Canada are from the high-resolution forecastsof the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) atmospheric model and outputsof the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA), but these datasets have ashort historical record. The EU WATCH ERA-Interim reanalysis (WFDEI) has alonger historical record but has often been found to be biased relative toobservations over Canada. The aim of this study, therefore, is to blend thestrengths of both datasets (GEM-CaPA and WFDEI) to produce a less-biasedlong-record product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) for hydrological modelling and climatechange impact assessment over the Mackenzie River Basin. First, amultivariate generalization of the quantile mapping technique wasimplemented to bias-correct WFDEI against GEM-CaPA at 3 h × 0.125 ∘ resolution during the 2005–2016 overlap period, followed by ahindcast of WFDEI-GEM-CaPA from 1979. The derived WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data arevalidated against station observations as a preliminary step to assess theiradded value. This product is then used to bias-correct climate projectionsfrom the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis CanadianRegional Climate Model (CanRCM4) between 1950 and 2100 under RCP8.5, and ananalysis of the datasets shows that the biases in the original WFDEI producthave been removed and the climate change signals in CanRCM4 are preserved.The resulting bias-corrected datasets are a consistent set of historical andclimate projection data suitable for large-scale modelling and futureclimate scenario analysis. The final historical product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA,1979–2016) is freely available at the Federated Research Data Repository at https://doi.org/10.20383/101.0111 (Asong et al.,2018), while the original and corrected CanRCM4 data are available at https://doi.org/10.20383/101.0162 (Asong et al., 2019).</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.98.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Permafrost is an important feature of cold-region hydrology, particularly inriver basins such as the Mackenzie River basin (MRB), and it needs to beproperly represented in hydrological and land surface models (H-LSMs) builtinto existing Earth system models (ESMs), especially under the unprecedentedclimate warming trends that have been observed. Higher rates of warming havebeen reported in high latitudes compared to the global average, resulting inpermafrost thaw with wide-ranging implications for hydrology and feedbacksto climate. The current generation of H-LSMs is being improved to simulatepermafrost dynamics by allowing deep soil profiles and incorporating organicsoils explicitly. Deeper soil profiles have larger hydraulic and thermalmemories that require more effort to initialize. This study aims to devise arobust, yet computationally efficient, initialization and parameterizationapproach applicable to regions where data are scarce and simulationstypically require large computational resources. The study furtherdemonstrates an upscaling approach to inform large-scale ESM simulationsbased on the insights gained by modelling at small scales. We usedpermafrost observations from three sites along the Mackenzie River valleyspanning different permafrost classes to test the validity of the approach.Results show generally good performance in reproducing present-climatepermafrost properties at the three sites. The results also emphasize thesensitivity of the simulations to the soil layering scheme used, the depthto bedrock, and the organic soil properties.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=D.+Princz" title="Search for 'D.
