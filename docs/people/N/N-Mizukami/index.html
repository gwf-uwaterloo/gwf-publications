Floods cause extensive damage, especially if they affect large regions. Assessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding under current and future climate conditions. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments.This study evaluates the extent to which models calibrated according to standard model calibration metrics such as the widely used Kling–Gupta efficiency are able to capture flood spatial coherence and triggering mechanisms.To highlight challenges related to flood simulations, we investigate how flood timing, magnitude, and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling–Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance also in flood-related studies. Specifically, we compare how four well-known models (the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, SAC; the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model, HBV; the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC; and the mesoscale hydrologic model, mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes.Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics are challenging as models underestimate flood magnitude, and flood timing is not necessarily well captured. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not always well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions.From a large sample of catchments and with multiple models, we conclude that calibration on the integrated Kling–Gupta metric alone is likely to yield models that have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, undermining their utility for regional and future change assessments. We underscore that such assessments can be improved by developing flood-focused, multi-objective, and spatial calibration metrics, by improving flood generating process representation through model structure comparisons and by considering uncertainty in precipitation input.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.58.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

We focus on the Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling‐Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (a) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (b) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (c) to prescribe the further research that is, needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large‐sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.67.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This enables improving the accuracy of the physical properties of the modeled river system, compared to a gridded river network that has been used in Earth System Models. With a finer‐scale river network, resolving smaller‐scale river reaches, there is a need for efficient methods to route streamflow and its constituents throughout the river network. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) develop a new method to decompose river networks into hydrologically independent tributary domains, where routing computations can be performed in parallel; and (2) perform global river routing simulations with two global river networks, with different scales, to examine the computational efficiency and the differences in discharge simulations at various temporal scales. The new parallelization method uses a hierarchical decomposition strategy, where each decomposed tributary is further decomposed into many sub‐tributary domains, enabling hybrid parallel computing. This parallelization scheme has excellent computational scaling for the global domain where it is straightforward to distribute computations across many independent river basins. However, parallel computing for a single large basin remains challenging. The global routing experiments show that the scale of the vector‐river network has less impact on the discharge simulations than the runoff input that is generated by the combination of land surface model and meteorological forcing. The scale of vector‐river networks needs to consider the scale of local hydrologic features such as lakes that are to be resolved in the network.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.78.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Yet very little is known about the impacts of reservoir expansion on the climate. Here, we implement reservoir construction in the Community Land Model by enabling dynamical lake area changes, while conserving mass and energy. Transient global lake and reservoir extent are prescribed from the HydroLAKES and Global Reservoir and Dam databases. Land‐only simulations covering the 20th century with reservoir expansion enabled, highlight increases in terrestrial water storage and decreases in albedo matching the increase in open water area. The comparison of coupled simulations including and excluding reservoirs shows only limited influence of reservoirs on global temperatures and the surface energy balance, but demonstrates substantial responses locally, in particular where reservoirs make up a large fraction of the grid cell. In those locations, reservoirs dampen the diurnal temperature range by up to −1.5 K (for reservoirs covering >15% of the grid cell), reduce temperature extremes, and moderate the seasonal temperature cycle. This study provides a first step towards a coupled representation of reservoirs in Earth System Models.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2020.GWF-1.82.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Land models are increasingly used in terrestrial hydrology due totheir process-oriented representation of water and energy fluxes. A priorispecification of the grid size of the land models is typically defined basedon the spatial resolution of forcing data, the modeling objectives, theavailable geospatial information, and computational resources. Thevariability of the inputs, soil types, vegetation covers, and forcing ismasked or aggregated based on the a priori grid size. In this study, we propose analternative vector-based implementation to directly configure a land modelusing unique combinations of land cover types, soil types, and other desiredgeographical features that have hydrological significance, such as elevationzone, slope, and aspect. The main contributions of this paper are to (1) implement the vector-based spatial configuration using the VariableInfiltration Capacity (VIC) model; (2) illustrate how the spatialconfiguration of the model affects simulations of basin-average quantities(i.e., streamflow) as well as the spatial variability of internal processes(snow water equivalent, SWE, and evapotranspiration, ET); and (3) describe the work and challenges ahead to improve thespatial structure of land models. Our results show that a modelconfiguration with a lower number of computational units, once calibrated,may have similar accuracy to model configurations with more computationalunits. However, the different calibrated parameter sets produce a range of,sometimes contradicting, internal states and fluxes. To better address theshortcomings of the current generation of land models, we encourage the landmodel community to adopt flexible spatial configurations to improve modelrepresentations of fluxes and states at the scale of interest.</div></div><h4>2019</h4><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.40.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In this study, we investigate the ways in which four different steps in the modeling chain influence the spread in projected changes of different aspects of hydrology. To form the basis of these analyses, we constructed an ensemble of 160 simulations from permutations of two Representative Concentration Pathways, 10 global climate models, two downscaling methods, and four hydrologic model implementations. The study is situated in the Pacific Northwest of North America, which has relevance to a diverse, multinational cast of stakeholders. We analyze the effects of each modeling decision on changes in gridded hydrologic variables of snow water equivalent and runoff, as well as streamflow at point locations. Results show that the choice of representative concentration pathway or global climate model is the driving contributor to the spread in annual streamflow volume and timing. On the other hand, hydrologic model implementation explains most of the spread in changes in low flows. Finally, by grouping the results by climate region the results have the potential to be generalized beyond the Pacific Northwest. Future hydrologic impact assessments can use these results to better tailor their modeling efforts.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.62.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Calibration is an essential step for improvingthe accuracy of simulations generated using hydrologic models. A key modelingdecision is selecting the performance metric to be optimized. It has beencommon to use squared error performance metrics, or normalized variants suchas Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), based on the idea that theirsquared-error nature will emphasize the estimates of high flows. However, weconclude that NSE-based model calibrations actually result in poorreproduction of high-flow events, such as the annual peak flows that are usedfor flood frequency estimation. Using three different types of performancemetrics, we calibrate two hydrological models at a daily step, the VariableInfiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM),and evaluate their ability to simulate high-flow events for 492 basinsthroughout the contiguous United States. The metrics investigated are(1) NSE, (2) Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its variants, and (3) annualpeak flow bias (APFB), where the latter is an application-specific metricthat focuses on annual peak flows. As expected, the APFB metric produces thebest annual peak flow estimates; however, performance on otherhigh-flow-related metrics is poor. In contrast, the use of NSE results inannual peak flow estimates that are more than 20 % worse, primarily dueto the tendency of NSE to underestimate observed flow variability. On theother hand, the use of KGE results in annual peak flow estimates that arebetter than from NSE, owing to improved flow time series metrics (mean andvariance), with only a slight degradation in performance with respect toother related metrics, particularly when a non-standard weighting of thecomponents of KGE is used. Stochastically generated ensemble simulationsbased on model residuals show the ability to improve the high-flow metrics,regardless of the deterministic performances. However, we emphasize thatimproving the fidelity of streamflow dynamics from deterministicallycalibrated models is still important, as it may improve high-flow metrics(for the right reasons). Overall, this work highlights the need for a deeperunderstanding of performance metric behavior and design in relation to thedesired goals of model calibration.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.162.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

These models have been calibrated using the Multiscale Parameter Regionalization scheme in a joint, multibasin approach using 492 medium‐sized basins across the CONUS yielding spatially distributed model parameter sets. The mHM simulations are used as a performance benchmark to examine performance deficiencies in the VIC model. We find that after calibration to streamflow, VIC generally overestimates the magnitude and temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) as compared to mHM as well as the FLUXNET observation‐based ET product, resulting in underestimation of the mean and variability of runoff. We perform a controlled calibration experiment to investigate the effect of varying number of transfer function parameters in mHM and to enable a fair comparison between both models (14 and 48 for mHM vs. 14 for VIC). Results of this experiment show similar behavior of mHM with 14 and 48 parameters. Furthermore, we diagnose the internal functioning of the VIC model by looking at the relationship of the evaporative fraction versus the degree of soil saturation and compare it with that of the mHM model, which has a different model structure, a prescribed nonlinear relationship between these variables and exhibits better model skill than VIC. Despite these limitations, the VIC‐based CONUS‐wide calibration constrained against streamflow exhibits better ET skill as compared to two preexisting independent VIC studies.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=N.+Mizukami" title="Search for 'N.
