After 2020, identifiers are of the form {year}.{venue}-{volume}.{#}, where {year} is the four-digit year, {venue} a lowercased venue code comprising ASCII letters and digits, {volume} is a volume name or number, and {#} is the paper number. Prior to 2020, this identifier took the form CYY-VPPP or CYY-VVPP, where C is a collection, YY a two-digit year, V a volume, and P a paper ID.</description></item><item><title>How can I submit attachments to papers?</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/faq/attachments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/faq/attachments/</guid><description>To submit paper attachments, use this Microsoft form. Important: If the file attachment cannot be downloaded automatically (via wget), processing of your attachment will fail. Many sharing sites (Github, Google Drive, Dropbox) display by default an HTML page. This complicates processing of attachments and increases the time it takes. Please manually check that you can download your file via wget.
Attachments are processed at least quarterly, at the beginning of January, April, July, and October.</description></item><item><title>How can I submit my proceedings or journal to the Anthology?</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/faq/submitting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/faq/submitting/</guid><description>Please see our submission guide.</description></item><item><title>How does the ACL Anthology use Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)?</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/faq/doi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/faq/doi/</guid><description>The ACL uses DOIs to refer to scholarly works persistently in accordance with cross-disciplinary standards. Prior to 2012, ACL materials were assigned DOIs by the Association of Computational Machinery (ACM). Since 2014, ACL has assigned its own DOIs to materials using a convention based off of the ACL Anthology Identifiers. In 2015, ACL had to change DOI prefix due to accounting practices for the ACM.

We generally distinguish five types, loosely following the ACM Publications Policy:
Corrections to metadata do not require changing the PDF. Examples include correcting the spelling of a name or the title. These kinds of corrections are typically made to bring the metadata in line with what is on the PDF, which is taken to be authoritative.</description></item><item><title>Information for Submitters</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/info/contrib/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/info/contrib/</guid><description>This page contains general information about submitting the proceedings of a conference to the ACL Anthology. (For information about the complete conference management process, particularly for ACL conference publications chairs, please refer to the official documentation.) It is intended for publication chairs of main conferences and standalone events, who have the responsibility of delivering the proceedings for all main conference and workshop volumes to the Anthology director. Chairs of workshops attached to a larger conference should also read this page, but should work through their main conference publication chair instead of directly with the Anthology.</description></item><item><title>Anthology development and API</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/info/development/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/info/development/</guid><description>API All Anthology data is stored under the data directory. In the xml directory are the files that contain all the Anthology metadata, in a format described below. The yaml directory contains various other important information.
In addition, we have a Python API that defines objects for papers, authors, volumes, and so on. This is all accessible by an Anthology object that can be access in the following manner. First, clone the Anthology Github repo and setup your environment:</description></item><item><title>GWF Publications</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/index_flex/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/index_flex/</guid><description>This is an attempt at using flexbox for the event table, to make it wrap nicely on smaller displays.

It is the repository of our community&amp;rsquo;s scientific contributions extending back over fifty years; its engine is nicely designed custom in-house software that still works well after almost two decades; and it has enabled research projects examining topics like author networks and topic shift over time. That all of this labor has been donated by its members further distinguishes the Anthology: it is not a found treasure, but one that has been crafted and shaped over countless hours, as if by a hundred Berninis, holding keyboards instead of chisels.</description></item><item><title>Twenty More Years of Computational Linguistics</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/posts/reflections-aj/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/posts/reflections-aj/</guid><description>The title can be read in two ways. Either I should comment on the past twenty years of ACL (which coincide with the period between ACL 1982 held at Penn and ACL 2002 also held at Penn) or twenty more years from ACL 2002. As you will see many of my comments will be relevant to both these interpretations.
How did I get into computational linguistics (CL)? I did not really get into it.</description></item><item><title>ACL 1993—1994</title><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/posts/reflections-ksj/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/posts/reflections-ksj/</guid><description>As an organisation, the ACL has clearly evolved over the forty years since its foundation. (Whether, or how, it has evolved in its area of intellectual interest over the same period is a tricky and interesting question.) The ACL&amp;rsquo;s organisational development in the period up to Don Walker&amp;rsquo;s death in 1993 was, however, rather different from its evolution since. This was partly because the ACL&amp;rsquo;s community was not very large in its first two decades, partly because there were only three Secretary-Treasurers in the whole period from 1963 to 1993.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-publications/volumes/G17-42/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00
