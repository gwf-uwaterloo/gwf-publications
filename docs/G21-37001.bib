    abstract = "Rivers are under enormous threat worldwide and large amounts of money are invested in river restoration. Contrary to the costs, the benefits of river restoration are much harder to quantify. In this study, the benefits of restoring different sections of the Yongding River in Beijing, China, are estimated through a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Place attachment is measured by sampling residents upstream and downstream and using the river sections as labelled alternatives in the DCE. As expected, the improvement of water quality is valued highly by all river basin residents, and place attachment and spatial preference heterogeneity play a significant role in public willingness to pay (WTP) for river restoration. Although respondents are willing to give up only a small share of their disposable income, public WTP for improved river water quality is a factor 2 to 4 higher than the current household water bill. These findings provide important guidance for the recovery of the investment costs associated with river restoration projects. {\mbox{$\bullet$}} The benefits of urban river restoration in Beijing are estimated {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Residents living up and downstream of the Yongding River are interviewed {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Public WTP for water quality improvements is several times higher than the current water bill {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Spatial preferences and place attachment play a key role in public preferences {\mbox{$\bullet$}} The study provides important info to guide investment decisions in river restoration",
