The forcing ensemble can be a collection of multiple deterministic meteorological datasets or come from an ensemble meteorological dataset. In hydrological model calibration, the forcing ensemble can be used to represent forcing data uncertainty. This study examines the potential of using the forcing ensemble to identify more robust parameters through model calibration. Specifically, we compare an ensemble forcing‐based calibration with two deterministic forcing‐based calibrations and investigate their flow simulation and parameter estimation properties and the ability to resist poor‐quality forcings. The comparison experiment is conducted with a six‐parameter hydrological model for 30 synthetic studies and 20 real data studies to provide a better assessment of the average performance of the deterministic and ensemble forcing‐based calibrations. Results show that the ensemble forcing‐based calibration generates parameter estimates that are less biased and have higher frequency of covering the true parameter values than the deterministic forcing‐based calibration does. Using a forcing ensemble in model calibration reduces the risk of inaccurate flow simulation caused by poor‐quality meteorological inputs, and improves the reliability and overall simulation skill of ensemble simulation results. The poor‐quality meteorological inputs can be effectively filtered out via our ensemble forcing‐based calibration methodology and thus discarded in any post‐calibration model applications. The proposed ensemble forcing‐based calibration method can be considered as a more generalized framework to include parameter and forcing uncertainties in model calibration.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.68.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This study employs a stochastic hydrologic modeling framework to evaluate the sensitivity of flood frequency analyses to different components of the hydrologic modeling chain. The major components of the stochastic hydrologic modeling chain, including model structure, model parameter estimation, initial conditions, and precipitation inputs were examined across return periods from 2 to 100 000 years at two watershedsrepresenting different hydroclimates across the western USA. A total of 10 hydrologic model structures were configured, calibrated, and run within the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) modular modelingframework for each of the two watersheds. Model parameters and initialconditions were derived from long-term calibrated simulations using a100 member historical meteorology ensemble. A stochastic event-basedhydrologic modeling workflow was developed using the calibrated models inwhich millions of flood event simulations were performed for each basin. The analysis of variance method was then used to quantify the relativecontributions of model structure, model parameters, initial conditions, andprecipitation inputs to flood magnitudes for different return periods.Results demonstrate that different components of the modeling chain havedifferent sensitivities for different return periods. Precipitation inputscontribute most to the variance of rare floods, while initial conditions aremost influential for more frequent events. However, the hydrological modelstructure and structure–parameter interactions together play an equallyimportant role in specific cases, depending on the basin characteristics and type of flood metric of interest. This study highlights the importance of critically assessing model underpinnings, understanding flood generationprocesses, and selecting appropriate hydrological models that are consistent with our understanding of flood generation processes.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2021.GWF-1.76.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Probabilistic methods are useful to estimate theuncertainty in spatial meteorological fields (e.g., the uncertainty inspatial patterns of precipitation and temperature across large domains). Inensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members areused to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, ofa spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the availableinformation. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact ofuncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications.This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America(EMDNA). EMDNA has 100 ensemble members with daily precipitation amount,mean daily temperature, and daily temperature range at 0.1∘spatial resolution (approx. 10 km grids) from 1979 to 2018, derived from afusion of station observations and reanalysis model outputs. The stationdata used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America(SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements usingmultiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded,corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimalinterpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates.EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated randomfields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) themerged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates,particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimatesare more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regressionestimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident insparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performanceaccording to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. Wediscuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that furtherresearch is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall,EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorologicalapplications in North America.

Calibration is an essential step for improvingthe accuracy of simulations generated using hydrologic models. A key modelingdecision is selecting the performance metric to be optimized. It has beencommon to use squared error performance metrics, or normalized variants suchas Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), based on the idea that theirsquared-error nature will emphasize the estimates of high flows. However, weconclude that NSE-based model calibrations actually result in poorreproduction of high-flow events, such as the annual peak flows that are usedfor flood frequency estimation. Using three different types of performancemetrics, we calibrate two hydrological models at a daily step, the VariableInfiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM),and evaluate their ability to simulate high-flow events for 492 basinsthroughout the contiguous United States. The metrics investigated are(1) NSE, (2) Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its variants, and (3) annualpeak flow bias (APFB), where the latter is an application-specific metricthat focuses on annual peak flows. As expected, the APFB metric produces thebest annual peak flow estimates; however, performance on otherhigh-flow-related metrics is poor. In contrast, the use of NSE results inannual peak flow estimates that are more than 20 % worse, primarily dueto the tendency of NSE to underestimate observed flow variability. On theother hand, the use of KGE results in annual peak flow estimates that arebetter than from NSE, owing to improved flow time series metrics (mean andvariance), with only a slight degradation in performance with respect toother related metrics, particularly when a non-standard weighting of thecomponents of KGE is used. Stochastically generated ensemble simulationsbased on model residuals show the ability to improve the high-flow metrics,regardless of the deterministic performances. However, we emphasize thatimproving the fidelity of streamflow dynamics from deterministicallycalibrated models is still important, as it may improve high-flow metrics(for the right reasons). Overall, this work highlights the need for a deeperunderstanding of performance metric behavior and design in relation to thedesired goals of model calibration.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.146.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This is motivated by the goal to provide the broad user community with knowledge of interproduct differences and the reasons differences exist. More generally, the challenge of generating station-based gridded meteorological surfaces and the difficulties in attributing interproduct differences to specific methodological decisions are demonstrated. Hawaii is a useful testbed because it is traditionally underserved, yet meteorologically interesting and complex. In addition, several climatological and daily gridded meteorology datasets are now available, which are used extensively by the applications modeling community, thus an intercomparison enhances Hawaiian specific capabilities. We compare PRISM climatology and three daily datasets: new datasets from the University of Hawai‘i and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Daymet version 3 for precipitation and temperature variables only. General conclusions that have emerged are 1) differences in input station data significantly influence the product differences, 2) explicit prediction of precipitation occurrence is crucial across multiple metrics, and 3) attribution of differences to specific methodological choices is difficult and limits the usefulness of intercomparisons. Because generating gridded meteorological fields is an elaborate process with many methodological choices interacting in complex ways, future work should 1) develop modular frameworks that allows users to easily examine the breadth of methodological choices, 2) collate available nontraditional high-quality observational datasets for true out-of-sample validation and make them publicly available, and 3) define benchmarks of acceptable performance for methodological components and products.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://gwf-uwaterloo.github.io/gwf-anthology/2019.GWF-1.162.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

These models have been calibrated using the Multiscale Parameter Regionalization scheme in a joint, multibasin approach using 492 medium‐sized basins across the CONUS yielding spatially distributed model parameter sets. The mHM simulations are used as a performance benchmark to examine performance deficiencies in the VIC model. We find that after calibration to streamflow, VIC generally overestimates the magnitude and temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) as compared to mHM as well as the FLUXNET observation‐based ET product, resulting in underestimation of the mean and variability of runoff. We perform a controlled calibration experiment to investigate the effect of varying number of transfer function parameters in mHM and to enable a fair comparison between both models (14 and 48 for mHM vs. 14 for VIC). Results of this experiment show similar behavior of mHM with 14 and 48 parameters. Furthermore, we diagnose the internal functioning of the VIC model by looking at the relationship of the evaporative fraction versus the degree of soil saturation and compare it with that of the mHM model, which has a different model structure, a prescribed nonlinear relationship between these variables and exhibits better model skill than VIC. Despite these limitations, the VIC‐based CONUS‐wide calibration constrained against streamflow exhibits better ET skill as compared to two preexisting independent VIC studies.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=A.+Newman" title="Search for 'A.
